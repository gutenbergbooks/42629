<h2>AUTHOR’S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In the following pages I present to the musical world the
History of the Violoncello and Violoncello playing. I have
preceded it by the History of the Viola da Gamba, for the
reason that this instrument must be considered the precursor
of the Violoncello. For my work I have made use of the
musical dictionaries extant, especially Gerber’s old and new
musical Lexicon as well as Fétis’s “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie Universelle
des Musiciens</span>.” What has been borrowed from other
works will be indicated in the course of the narrative. The
great courtesy of Herr Friedrich Grützmacher, the Royal
Concert-director of Saxony, in placing at my disposal his
extensive collection of old and new Violoncello Literature,
has been of especial value to me in my undertaking. By
its means I have been enabled to find my way through
the historical development of Violoncello composition. I
willingly seize this opportunity of expressing my thanks
to him for it.</p>

<h2>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.</h2>


<p>It may be that we are not a musical people, but if so the
encouragement and appreciation which the sister Art to painting
has of late years received in England is not a proof of the
truth of the assertion frequently made. Our Concert-rooms
are always crowded to overflowing; foreign artists think it
worth while to come year by year to England; schools of music
are multiplying, and eagerly attended by amateurs as well as
professionals; and I think it may now be taken for granted
that a musical education may be as thoroughly acquired here
as abroad. Every kind of musical instrument is taken up, if
not always with a really serious intention; but no instrument
has more rapidly or more certainly come into favour amongst
all lovers of music, as well with those who study as with
those who listen, than the Violoncello. It is therefore
somewhat surprising that up to the present time no book has
been published in English, either as regarding its History or
its Literature. This consideration, as well as the hope that
not only those who devote themselves to the Violoncello, either
as professors or amateurs, may be interested in its History, but
also the general musical public who delight in listening to its
deeply pathetic tones as produced by the great masters of it,
has induced me to attempt the translation of Mr. Wasielewski’s
interesting work. We love to know and often take pains
to enquire into the history of any favourite picture, to learn
something of the artist’s life, the circumstances under which
he painted it, and often the origin of its conception. I therefore
hope that the story of the Violoncello will be acceptable to all
who love it and give their lives to the development of its many
beauties and capabilities.</p>

<p>The account of the Violoncello’s forerunner, the Viola da
Gamba, cannot but be especially interesting, this instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
having been formerly cultivated in England to so great an
extent. The frequent allusions which Praetorius in his
“Syntagma Musicum” makes to English Gamba players, with
a decided preference to their manner of playing and tuning
their instruments, is a proof of how high their reputation was
abroad; and if any further evidence were wanting the dictum
of Mersennus that English Gambists excelled all other nations
in Gamba playing, is sufficient to show that in the sixteenth
and part of the seventeenth centuries they held the first rank.
If for a short period we have no violoncellist of extraordinary
merit to chronicle, more modern times have produced artists
who will bear comparison with any of the greatest players on
the Continent. Concerning these and English Gamba players
I have ventured to add a few more particulars than Mr.
Wasielewski has given, hoping they would prove interesting
to English readers. These details have been gathered from
Grove’s Dictionary, Leslie Stephen’s Nat. Biography, and
various other works. For the technical portion, Mr. Niecks’s
Dictionary of Musical Terms has been consulted, as well as
Mendel and Dommer. I have supplemented the Violoncello
Schools by others collected from Mr. Heron Allen’s Bibliography,
and various sources, introducing some of the old
Instruction books for the Gamba.</p>

<p>I must here thank Mr. Wasielewski for his kind permission
to translate his valuable work, as well as Messrs. Breitkopf
and Härtel for their courteous assistance. I beg Mr. George
Herbert to accept my grateful acknowledgment for his most
kind help and encouragement, and Mr. Heron Allen for the
interest he has taken in my work. To Mr. Arthur Hill I am
indebted for much kind advice, and to Mr. Nosèda of the Strand
for his courteous permission to reproduce from his oil-painting
the portrait of Robert Lindley as a Frontispiece.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>




<h3>Viol da Gamba.</h3>


<p>The history of the Violoncello and Violoncello playing is
connected in its early stages up to a certain point with that
of the Viola da Gamba and its forerunner, “the Basso di
Viola,” of the sixteenth century. This last-named instrument
formed the bass in the string quartets of that time, to which
also belonged, according to the Italian designation, the
“Discant-Viola” or “Violetta,” as well as the “Viola d’Alta”
and “di Tenore.” In Germany these instruments were called
Diskant, Alto, Tenor, and Bass viols. The terms Viola and
Violin,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were at that time consequently synonymous. From
the foregoing remarks it will be perceived that it is a question
not of one kind, but of a whole family of stringed instruments.
Descriptions and illustrations of them are found in the
following music-authors of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sebastian Virdung</span>: “Musica getutscht,” 1511; <span class="smcap">Hans
Judenkünig</span>: “Ain schöne kunstliche Vnderwaisung,” u.s.w.,
1523; <span class="smcap">Martin Agricola</span>: “Musica instrumentalis deutsch,”
1528; <span class="smcap">Hans Gerle</span>: “Musica Teusch” (Teutsch), 1532;
<span class="smcap">Ottomar Luscinius</span>: (Nachtgall), “Musurgia seu praxis
Musicæ,” 1536; and <span class="smcap">Ganassi del Fontego</span>: “Regola Rubertina,”
1542. Agricola’s and Gerle’s works appeared in various
editions. The work of the former, as well as Luscinius’
“Musurgia,” are partly reproductions of Virdung’s “Musica
getutscht.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;">
<a href="images/illt002h.jpg">
<img src="images/illt002.jpg" width="447" height="500" alt="Bridgeless viola and player." /></a>
</div>

<p>According to the descriptions of the above-named authors,
violas or violins were of two kinds.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Some of them had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
bridge, others, on the contrary, were provided with
one. For the object before us the last only claim
our consideration, of which, as well as of the bridgeless
violins, there were four different examples. The alto and
the tenor were the same size, but of different methods of
tuning. The so-called violas (fiddles) were provided with six
strings which were called, like the six lute chords, Great
Bumhardt (Bombarte), middle ditto (tenor); small ditto
(counter-tenor); middle string (great mean); vocal string
(small mean); and quint string (treble). The “Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Bumhardt” was left out in those instruments provided with
five strings only. In Italy the six strings were called: Basso,
Bordone, Tenore, Mezzanella or Mezzana, Sottanella or
Sotana, and Canto. In France, according to Mersennus:
Sixiesme, Cinquiesme, Quatriesme, Troisiesme, Seconde, and
Chanterelle. The same author gives for the violas the names:
“Dessus,” “Haut Contre,” “Taille,” and “Basse Contre.”</p>

<p>In Judenkünig’s and Hans Gerle’s works are found the
accompanying illustrations of stringed instruments provided
with a bridge. Their identity is unmistakable, though
they differ from each other in many peculiarities of form.
Both instruments represent the so-called “big fiddle”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
or “Basso di Viola.” The tuning was that of the lute, which,
as an older stringed instrument, served in this respect as its
model. Only in regard to the pitch did any difference exist.
Judenkünig makes it thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/illt003a.png" width="363" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Hans Gerle, on the contrary, writes it thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/illt003b.png" width="370" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Here the pitch of the second is a fifth lower than the first.
Judenkünig’s pitch represents the tenor and that of Gerle
the bass. Agricola says in his “Musica instrumentalis,”
regarding the height of pitch for the lute:</p>

<div class="poem"><div lang="de" xml:lang="de" class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Zeuch die Quintsait so hoch du magst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Das sie nicht reist wenn du sie schlagst.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(Draw up the fifth string as high as you may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it may not be broken when on it you play.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in Hans Neusiedler’s Lute-book (1535) it is said: “He
who wishes to learn how to tune the lute, let him draw up
the Quint string, not too high, and not too low, a medium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
height, as much as the strings will bear.” Similar instructions
are to be found in Gerle’s “Musica Teutsch.”</p>

<p>The capability of tension of the Quint string was consequently
the guide for the pitch in tuning the lute&mdash;beyond this there
was as yet no normal pitch&mdash;and in stringed instruments it was
in every case so maintained. In playing with wind instruments
the stringed instruments had, therefore, to adapt the
pitch to them.</p>

<p>The “great violins” were, in the first half of the sixteenth
century at least, according to all appearance played in two
ways. From the drawing in Judenkünig’s treatise, a mode of
handling is seen which requires no further explanation.
That the handling of the “great violin” represented by
Judenkünig without any explanation is treated of as not
exceptional appears also from the accompanying vignette
of another publication of that period.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/illt004h.jpg">
<img src="images/illt004.jpg" width="500" height="380" alt="Performing on the bass viol." /></a>
</div>

<p>The bass viol performing with the two lutists represents
the same position and manner of playing as the woodcut in
Judenkünig’s treatise, with the sole difference that he is
holding his instrument in the left hand, whereas the peg-box
of the instrument, bent sharply backwards, of Judenkünig’s
player rests on his shoulder. It is very evident that in
both cases scarcely more could be executed than the simplest
bass accompaniment. More, however, was eventually to be
produced according to the treatment of the “great violin”
prescribed by Gerle. He says regarding it: “When you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
according to my instructions ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">beschriben</span>’ (noted),<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> tuned and
drawn up the violin, and wish to begin playing, proceed thus:
Take the neck of the instrument in the left hand and the bow
in the right, sit down and press the viola between the legs, that
you may not strike it with the bow, and take care when you play
that you draw the bow directly and evenly over the strings
neither too far from nor too near the bridge<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> on which the
strings lie, and that you do not draw the bow over two strings
at once, but only over that which is placed under the figuring
in the Tablature, and this must be especially attended to.”</p>

<p>It appears, according to Gerle’s instructions, that the
instrument of which he speaks was a so-called “Knee violin”&mdash;in
Italian, “Viola da gamba.” It seems, however, that in
the sixteenth century this description was not in common
use. Hans Gerle, a native of Nuremberg, born about 1500,
had already received important consideration during the first
twenty years of the sixteenth century, not only as a skilful
performer, but also as a maker of lutes and viols. Yet the
making of these instruments, and especially of viols, had
already been carried on at a much earlier period by others.
The oldest fiddle or viola maker of whom we have any
mention is a certain Kerlino, who, according to Fétis’s
account, lived and worked in Brescia. It is most probable
that he was a German, or at least of German extraction, for
the name Kerl, in every kind of variation, both as a common
and individual or family name, had been constantly in use
among the German races. In the German dictionary<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of
the Brothers Grimm are indicated the various forms of
the name “Kerl”: Kerle, formerly Kärle; Kerls, Kerles,
Kerlis, Kerli, Kerlin, Kerel, Kaerl, Kerdel, and Kirl. They
are of German origin, and are derived from middle or low
German, whereas the Anglo-Saxon equivalents are “Carl,”
or “Ceorl.”</p>

<p>Originally the word “Kerl” (kerle), according to Grimm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
was synonymous with “Mann” (man), and also with Ehemann
(husband). But it was also used as a family or tribal name,
as is proved from the names Jacob de Kerle (sixteenth
century), Joh. Kaspar von Kerll (also written Kerl, Kherl,
Cherle), born 1628, and Vitus Kerle (in the eighteenth century).<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Another form of “Kerl,” Kerlin, was, according to Grimm,
used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Who can
doubt then that the Brescian instrument maker Kerlino was
of German origin?<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He was, evidently, originally called
Kerl or Kerlin, to which name was added by the Italians
either the diminutive syllable “ino” or the vowel “o.” It
cannot be of Italian origin, for the Italian has no “k.”</p>

<p>Fétis informs us that Kerlino must be considered as the
founder of the school of Brescian viola makers which, as the
oldest in Italy from the middle of the sixteenth century,
attained such a great reputation, through Gaspar da Salò and
his reputed pupil, Giov. Paolo Maggini. If what appears
so extremely probable has any real foundation, to a German,
or, at least, to a man of German extraction, must be justly
conceded the merit of having, in a measure, been the originator
of the art of Italian stringed instrument making which later
on developed to the highest point.</p>

<p>Further, we learn from Fétis that in the year 1804 a
Parisian violin maker, named Koliker, was in possession of a
violin which had been previously described by the French
writer on music, de la Borde, containing the inscription</p>

<p class="center">
“<span class="smcap">Joan. Kerlino, ann. 1449</span>,”
</p>

<p>and which originally had been a “Viola da braccio.” Doubtless
this remarkable instrument exists at the present time.
Fétis, who saw it himself, describes its quality of tone as
“agreeably soft and faintly subdued.” Among the composers
who wrote for the viola, we must mention Giov. Battista
Bonometti, born at Bergamo about the end of the sixteenth
century. In 1615 he caused to be published in Vienna a
collection of trios for two violas and a bass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>After Kerlino there appeared in North Italy as noted lute
and viola makers the monk Pietro Dardelli, in Mantua about
1500; Gaspard Duiffopruggar, in Bologna, 1510; Venturi
Linarolli (Linelli), in Venice, 1520; Peregrino Zanetto, in
Brescia in 1530; and Morglato Morella, in Venice, 1550.
Amongst these G. Duiffopruggar is evidently of German
birth,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and remarkable as having, as far as we can see, made
the first violins.</p>

<p>This artist was in 1515 summoned to France by King
Francis I.; he at first lived in Paris and then at Lyons.
He made some excellent Bass viols (Gambas), of which two
fine specimens are extant in France. A similar bass viol
was represented by Raphael in his painting of St. Cecilia.
This splendid picture, in the Pinacothek at Bologna, existed
in 1515.</p>

<p>After Duiffopruggar, Andreas Amati (1520 to about 1580),
the founder of the Cremona school, distinguished himself in
the making of violas (as well as violins). His instruments
obtained such a great reputation that Charles IX. of France,
an enthusiastic amateur of music, had twenty-four violins,
six tenors, and eight basses made by him. Amongst the
latter there were several bass viols, like the viola da gamba.
The instruments made for Charles IX. by Andrea Amati were
every one of them destroyed during the French Revolution of
1792.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Contemporaneously with Andreas Amati the manufacture
of stringed instruments was vigorously carried on by Gaspard
da Salò, in Brescia.</p>

<p>In Germany, from the second half of the sixteenth century,
<span class="smcap">Lauxmin Possen</span>, in 1550, at Schongau, subsequently instrument
maker for the Hofkapelle at Munich; <span class="smcap">Joh. Kohl</span>, who at the
same time worked at Munich and in 1599 was appointed
Court instrument maker there, and also <span class="smcap">Joachim Tielke</span> were
successively celebrated. The latter lived, as Gerber informs
us, at Hamburg from about 1660 to 1730, and even made lutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of real ivory and ebony, the necks of which were inlaid with
gold and silver and mother-of-pearl, but one especially with
nine pegs of the most beautiful tortoiseshell. Tielke,
however, made also violins and excellent gambas. One of
these, a costly instrument which was formerly in the
possession of the Elector Joh. Wilhelm of the Palatinate,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> was
brought from Mannheim to the Duke of Maxburg’s Museum
at Munich, and thence into the Royal Bavarian National
Museum, where it is preserved as a treasure of rare value.
The peg-box, the fingerboard, the tail-piece, the sides, and
the back are all decorated with designs of flowers, foliage,
and tendrils, as well as symbolical and allegorical representations
taken from mythology, the subjects representing for
the most part love and music. These decorations and designs
are inlaid work in tortoiseshell, ivory, ebony, mother-of-pearl
and silver.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Another valuable specimen of a gamba made by Tielke
in the year 1701, which belonged to the famous cello
virtuoso, F. Servais, has been described and represented
by A. J. Hipkins, of Edinburgh, in his lately published
work, “Musical Instruments: Historic, Rare and Unique.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>During the second half of the sixteenth century there
must have been a considerable multiplication of the different
kinds of violas then in use, and especially of the bass
viol, for Michael Prätorius mentions in his “Syntagma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
musicum,” which appeared in 1614-1620, the following
examples:</p>

<p>1. Very large Bass Viol with four strings (corresponding to
the modern Contrabasso).</p>

<p>2. Great Bass Viol de Gamba in three different tunings,
with five and also six strings (also like the Contrabasso).</p>

<p>3. Small Bass Viol de Gamba, five different examples with
six, four, and three strings (answering in tone, in some
measure, to the modern Violoncello).</p>

<p>4. Tenor and Alto Viol de Gamba, in two different pitches,
with six, five, four, and three strings (answering partly to
the Violoncello and partly to the modern Tenor).</p>

<p>5. Cant Viol de Gamba (Violetta piccola), four different
kinds with six, five, four, and three strings (the tone also
partly answering to the Tenor and partly to the Violin).</p>

<p>6. Viol Bastarda, in five different pitches, with six strings
(the tone corresponding to that of the Cello).</p>

<p>7. Viola de Braccio, four different examples, with five and
four strings (corresponding in tone partly to the Violoncello
and partly to that of the Tenor).</p>

<p>Moreover, Prätorius mentions, under the heading “Viole de
Braccio Viols,” the “Discant Viol” (our modern Violin), the
small “Discant Viol” (tuned a fourth higher than our Violin),
and two “very small Viols with three strings,” of which the
lowest string of the first is a ninth and of the second an octave
higher than the G String of the Violin.</p>

<p>Of the multitude of these different kinds of Viols then in
use, which later on by manifold improvements were gradually
reduced to a smaller number, until they resulted in the
modern Violin and Tenor, as well as the Violoncello and
Contrabasso, we must keep in view, for the object of the
present work, the “Viola da Gamba” only, which must be
regarded as the precursor of the violoncello. Prätorius gives
a sketch (annexed) of the so-named instrument.</p>

<p>A comparison of these gambas with the sketches of viols by
Judenkünig and Gerle shows what substantial alterations the
stringed instrument in question underwent in the course of
the second half of the sixteenth century. The neck had
assumed a more modern and more convenient form for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
technique of the left hand and the sounding-board had
acquired more elegant and attractive outlines. At the same
time the sound-holes, corresponding to the curves of the
belly, were turned round and placed in a position more
agreeable to the eye.</p>

<p>Prätorius expresses himself regarding the Viola da Gamba as
follows: “Violas, viols, and violuntzes<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> are of two kinds&mdash;1. Viole
de gamba; 2. Viole de braccio (or de brazzio)&mdash;and the former
is so called from having been held between the legs; for
gamba is an Italian word and means a leg; le gambe, the legs.
And since they have much larger bodies and, on account of the
length of the neck, have strings of a much longer tension,
they produce a mellower resonance than others, ‘di braccio,’
which are held on the arm. The two kinds are distinguished
by town musicians: the viole de gamba by the name of violas:
the viole ‘di braccio’ (among which Prätorius
includes violins) by the name of fiddles or
pollish fiddles....</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 130px;">
<a href="images/illt010h.jpg">
<img src="images/illt010.jpg" width="130" height="400" alt="Viola da Gamba." /></a>
</div>

<p>“The Violes de Gamba have six strings
and are tuned in fourths and in the middle
a third, exactly like the six-stringed lute.
Englishmen when they play them alone sometimes
tune them a fourth, sometimes a fifth
lower, so that the lowest strings are tuned&mdash;the
bass to D, the tenor and alto to A, and
the canto to E. On other occasions each one
(reckoning by the chamber-pitch)<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> a fifth
lower&mdash;as, for example, the bass to G G, the
tenor and alto to D, the canto to A; and
tuning in this manner produces much more
agreeable, grander, and more majestic harmonies
than when the instruments are at the
usual pitch.”</p>

<p>What Prätorius says regarding the mode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and way of English viol-tuning is supplemented by Mersennus
in his “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Harmonie Universelle</span>” (1636-37). This author says:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut remarquer que les Anglois ioüent ordinairement
leurs pièces un ton plus bas que les Français, afin d’entendre
l’harmonie plus douce et plus charmante, et conséquemment
que leur sixiesme chorde à vuide fait le C sol au lieu que la
nostre fait le D re sol</span>.”</p>

<p>The pitch then in England was a varying one, though the
series of intervals borrowed from the lute, to which the gamba
like the bass viol was tuned, were those which commonly
prevailed.</p>

<p>In other respects, Mersennus gives no more explicit
directions for the handling of the Viola da Gamba than
Prätorius. He does not use this name for the instrument
in question, but calls it “Basse de Viole.” The French
designation, “Viole de jambe,” corresponding to the Italian
name, appears consequently to have been in vogue later and
to have been generally little used.</p>

<p>Like Gerle’s “great fiddle” (Basso di Viola), the Viola da
Gamba had also as a rule seven frets on the fingerboard like
the lute, for fixing the tones and semitones.</p>

<p>The gamba was played in various ways, and used for a variety
of musical purposes, as a solo instrument, as well as in
orchestral performances, and as an accompaniment to
singing. The way in which it was valued during the first
half of the seventeenth century as an obbligato accompaniment
to singing, may be seen from the preface to Heinrich
Schütz’s “Historia of the joyful and victorious resurrection of
our only Saviour,” and so on, published in 1623. It is there
said, after Schütz has named the instruments which are to
accompany the parts of the Evangelists: “But when it can
be done it is better that the organ and everything else should
be left out and instead of these only four Viole di Gamba
(which must also be present), should be used to accompany
the parts of the Evangelists.”</p>

<p>“It will, however, be necessary that the four viols should
be thoroughly ‘<em>practised</em>’ with the part of the Evangelist in
the following manner: The Evangelist takes his part to
himself, and recites it straight through without any fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
time, just as it seems correct to him, but not holding
longer on one syllable than is customary in ordinary slow
and distinct speaking. The violas must not mark any
particular time, but only pay attention to the words recited
by the Evangelist, and to their parts written below the
‘falso-bordone’ and so doing they cannot go wrong. A
viola may also ‘passegiren’ amongst the others, as is usual
with the falso-bordone,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and this gives a good effect.”</p>

<p>It appears from the explanation that the gambas were used
to support the harmonies of recitatives. The “passegiren”
suggested by Schütz of one of the accompanying violas was
nothing else than the usual improvised ornamental colorature
or diminuendos used at that time and up to the eighteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>For solo playing gambas were used not only for the
execution of monotone&mdash;viz., compositions of one part only;
but also for several parts, and especially for double-stops
and chords.</p>

<p>The oldest French gambist of whom we have any account
is a certain Granier. Gerber says, concerning him, that he
had been “in the service of Queen Margaret of France,” and
died, about 1600, in Paris, and that he was the greatest artist
of his time on the gamba.</p>

<p>Concerning the artistic use of violas, amongst which, as
already said, gambas were included, Mersennus writes as
follows: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Encore que les Violes soient capables de toutes
sortes de musique, et que les exemples que j’ay donné (<i>sic</i>)
pour le concert,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> des violons leur puissent servir, néantmoins
elles demandent des pièces, plus tristes et plus graves, et dont
la mesure soit plus longue et plus tardiue; de là vient qu’elles
sont plus propres pour accompagner les voix. Or l’on peut
jouer toutes sortes de pièces non seulement à cinq parties,
comme l’on fait ordinairement sur les Violons, mais à six, à
sept, à douze et à tout autant de parties que l’on veut</span>.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of the above-quoted passage it is remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that violas were used for every kind of music, but the use
of these instruments for solo playing is not expressly
mentioned. In another passage of his work Mersennus says,
however, with regard to gamba playing and the French
performers of his time:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Personne en France n’égale Maugars et Hottman,
hommes très habiles dans cet art: ils excellent dans les
diminutions et par leurs traits d’archet incomparables de
delicatesse et de suaveté. Il n’y a rien dans l’harmonie qu’ils
ne savent exprimer avec perfection, surtout lorsqu’une autre
personne les accompagne sur le clavicorde. Mais le premier
exécute seul et à la fois deux, trois ou plusieurs parties sur la
basse de viole avec tant d’ornements et un prestesse de doigts
dont il parait si peu se préoccuper, qu’on n’avait rien
entendu de pareil auparavant par ceux qui jouaient de la viole
ou même de tout autre instrument.....</span>”</p>

<p>It is here clearly expressed that solo playing on the gamba,
and notably in several parts, was much cultivated and highly
appreciated.</p>

<p>The Maugars<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> here mentioned by Mersennus expresses
himself regarding his own performances as a gamba player in
his “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réponse fait a un curieux sur le sentiment de la
Musique d’Italie écrite à Rome le premier Octobre, 1639,</span>”
which was published either at the end of 1639 or the beginning
of 1640. After having spoken of his intercourse with the
artistic family Baroni during his residence in Rome, he
relates:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In this worthy house, at the solicitation of these gifted
people, I was induced for the first time to exhibit in Rome the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
talent with which God had endowed me. It happened in the
presence of ten or twelve of the most experienced people of
Italy, who, after they had listened to me attentively, bestowed
on me some eulogiums; not, however, quite ungrudgingly.</p>

<p>“In order to test me further the Signora Leonora (Baroni)
induced me to leave my viola at her house, and begged me to
return the following day. This I did, and as it was reported
to me by a friend that it was said I played studied things very
well, on the second occasion I gave them so many kinds of
preludes and fantasias that they really granted me more
appreciation than the first time. The respect, however, of
these worthy people did not succeed in winning over the
experts, who were somewhat over-refined and reticent to
concede applause to a foreigner. It was told me they acknowledged
that I played very well alone, and that they had never
heard such harmonised viola playing, but they doubted if I
were capable of extemporising a theme and playing variations
on it. You know, sir, that in this I am not a little successful.
The same words had been told me on the eve of St. Louis’ day
in the French church, while I was listening to the fine music
then being performed there. This determined me on the next
day, excited thereto by the name of Saint Louis, as well as
for the honour of the nation and the thirty-three cardinals
who were present and taking part in the Mass, to ascend into
the gallery. When I had been greeted with applause, I was
given fifteen to twenty notes, in order to make myself heard
after the third Kyrie with the accompaniment of a small
organ. This subject I treated with such infinite variety that
great satisfaction was shown, and the cardinals caused me to
be invited to play again after the Agnus Dei.</p>

<p>“I considered myself very fortunate that I had been able to
afford this little pleasure to so distinguished a company. I was
given another somewhat more cheerful theme than the first,
which I treated with so many variations and such a diversity
of movements that they were extremely astonished, and
immediately came to me in order to requite me with eulogiums.
On account of the friendship which you cherish for me, my
dear sir, I am convinced you will not accuse me of vanity in
this digression. I have only made it in order that you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
know that if a Frenchman desires to gain a reputation in
Rome he must be well armed; and so much the more because
it is thought here that we are not capable of improvising on a
given theme. In fact, whoever plays an instrument deserves
no extraordinary consideration, unless he shows himself equal
to such a demand, especially for the viola&mdash;to play on which,
by reason of its few strings and the consequent difficulty of
playing in parts, is always a thankless task&mdash;it is necessary to
possess some individual talent in order to be inspired by a
subject and expand into beautiful inventions as well as
agreeable variations. The capacity to do this requires two
real and innate qualifications&mdash;viz., a lively and strong imagination
and skilful execution, in order promptly to carry out
one’s ideas.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The unlimited tribute of praise which Mersennus pays to the
performances of Maugars, renders credible the remarkable
account given by himself. Maugars’ gamba playing excited in
Rome the greatest consideration, because at that time neither
there nor anywhere else in Italy was there any prominent artist
for that instrument. “As regards viola playing, Maugars
declares there is no one in Italy who is distinguished for it,
and in Rome it is very little cultivated. This has greatly
astonished me, as formerly they had a certain Horace of
Parma who performed wonderfully on this instrument, and
left behind him some excellent compositions, which some of
our musicians cleverly made use of for other instruments
besides those for which they were composed. The father of
the great Italian, Ferabosco, was the first to make them known
to the English, who from that time have excelled all other
nations.”</p>

<p>From the last words it is to be inferred that gamba playing
in England was much in vogue at the time of Maugars. The
Ferabosco (Ferrabosco)&mdash;with the christian name of Alfonso&mdash;mentioned
by him, who first made the English acquainted
with this art, can be no other than the composer of that name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
referred to by Fétis as born in Italy about 1515. He settled
in London about 1540, and about the year 1587 appears to
have been in the service, as “gentilumo,” of the Duke of
Savoy.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Amongst English gambists of distinction must be named
Thomas Robinson, Tobias Hume, William Brade, and John
Jenkins. Probably they were all pupils of the elder Ferabosco.</p>

<p>Concerning <span class="smcap">Thomas Robinson</span>, who was born in the second
half of the sixteenth century, and lived and worked in the
beginning of the seventeenth in London, nothing further
is known than that he published a curious work under the
title, “The Schoole of Musicke: the perfect method of true
fingering the Lute, Pandora, Orpharion, and Viol da gamba.
London, 1603.”</p>

<p>His contemporary, <span class="smcap">Tobias Hume</span>, was an officer in the
English army, and spent much of his time in Sweden.
He was reputed one of the cleverest gambists of that
period; he caused to be published, in 1605, a work with
the following title: “The first part of Ayres, French, Pollish,
and others together, some in Tabliture and some in Pricke
song. With Pauines, Galliards, and Almaines for the Viole di
gamba, and other Musicall Conceites for two Basse-viols,
expressing five partes, with pleasant Reportes one from the
other; and also for two Leero-Viols, and also for the Leero-Viole
with two Treble Viols, or two with one Treble. Lastly,
for the Leero-Viole to play alone; and some Songes to bee
sung to the Viole with the Lute, or better with the Viole alone.
Also an Invention for two to play upon one Viole. Composed
by Tobias Hume, gentleman. Printed by John Windet Loud,
dwelling at the sign of the Cross Keyes, at Powles Wharfe,
1605.” It is evident that the composition of arrangements for
two instruments, which might also be played on one only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was no invention of the Salzburg violinist, Joh. Hein. Biber.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
In 1607 he published another work, under the title “Captain
Hume’s Poeticall Musicke, principally made for two basse viols
yet so contrived that it may be plaied eight severall waies upon
sundry instruments with much facilitie. London.” This
work, of which the British Museum possesses a copy, was
dedicated to Anne of Denmark. He was received into the
Charterhouse as a poor brother in 1629, and known as
“Captain Hume.” His mind seems to have given way, and
he died there on April 16, 1645.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Brade</span> flourished about 1615, and spent much of
his life out of England. He was appointed violist to the
Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and of the city of Hamburg at the
beginning of the seventeenth century. In 1619 he seems to
have been Capellmeister to the Margrave of Brandenburg
and went subsequently to Berlin. He was esteemed a good
performer on the gamba, and published in 1609, 1614, and
1621 a number of Paduans or Pavans, Gaillards, Canzonets,
Volts, Courantes, in five and six parts (Berlin, 1621). A great
confusion exists regarding the bibliography of his works,
authorities differ as to their titles. They are of unusual
interest, as containing many English airs, some of which are
mentioned by Shakespeare. He is said to have died at
Frankfort in 1647.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Jenkins</span>, born at Maidstone in 1592, was one of the
most celebrated composers of music for viols. In early life
he made choice of music as a profession, and was appointed
musician in ordinary to Charles I. He lived in the family
of Sir Hamon l’Estrange and instructed his sons in music.
In 1660 he gave lessons to the sons of Lord North at a salary
of £1 a quarter! Roger North in his autobiography calls
him, “that eminent master of his time, Mr. Jenkins, not
conceited nor morose, but much a gentleman.” He was
appointed musician to Charles II., and spent the last years
of his life with Sir Philip Wodehouse, at Kimberley, in Norfolk,
where he died on October 27, 1678. He had for his time
extraordinary capacity on the lute, viol, and several bowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
instruments, and wrote a great number of compositions for
viols, which were not printed; but in 1660 he published
“Twelve Sonatas for two violins and a bass, with a thorough-bass
for the organ or theorbo” (London, 1660), the first
of the kind produced by an Englishman. Indeed he is
credited with having been the earliest English composer of
instrumental music. Most of his compositions he called
Rants or Fancies. He also wrote music for “Theophila, or
Love’s Sacrifice; a Divine Poem, by Edward Benlowes, Esq.,
several parts thereof set to fit Aires by Mr. Jenkins” (London,
1652). Many of his MSS. exist at Christchurch, Oxford.
Hawkins reports that it was said of him, “he was a little
man, but had a great soul.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Simpson</span> is another Englishman who stands out
conspicuously as a violist and gamba player; in 1615 he was
appointed violist in the service of the Prince of Holstein-Schaumberg.
He published: Opusculum, Neuer Pavanen,
Gaillards, Couranten und Volts (Frankfurt, 1610); besides
Pavanen, Volts und Gaillards (Frankfurt, 1611), and a “Tafel-Consort,”
containing all kinds of cheerful songes for four
Instruments and a Thorough-Bass (Hamburg, 1621).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Cooper</span>, born about 1570, was a most distinguished
performer on, and good composer for the Viol da Gamba. In
his youth he travelled in Italy, and returned with the
Italianised name of Coperario. He was master to the
children of James I., who was himself not only very musical,
but had an excellent judgment on music. He is said to have
played eight different instruments, amongst them especially
well the harp. Two of Cooper’s pupils were the celebrated
musicians, William and Henry Lawes. The elder, William,
besides his other numerous compositions, wrote his “Great
Consort,” consisting of six Suites for two treble viols, two
theorbos, and two bass-viols. Charles I. was also Cooper’s
pupil and played the gamba well, since he was able to perform
the organ fantasias of his master on that instrument.
Cooper published a great number of compositions, and
among them were many for the Gamba. He died during the
Protectorate.</p>

<p>By far the most eminent English gamba player was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Christopher Sympson</span><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> (or Simpson), who was born at the
beginning of the seventeenth century, and died in London
between 1667 and 1670. He was a follower of Charles I., and
served as a soldier in the army commanded by the Duke of
Newcastle against the Parliament. After the defeat of the
Royalists, Sir Rob. Bolles, an important adherent of this party,
granted him a refuge in his house and entrusted to him the
education of his son, John Bolles, who was noted as a very
clever musical dilettante and player on the gamba; he died
in Rome, 1676, where his mortal remains were laid in the
Pantheon. Christopher Sympson is the author of several
noteworthy instruction books on music, of which we shall
mention only those relating to the viol da gamba. The
first of them has the title, “The Division-violist, or the
Introduction to the playing upon a ground. Divided in
two parts&mdash;the first, directing the hands, with other preparative
instructions; the second, laying open the manner
and method of playing, or composing division to a ground.
London: John Playford. 1659.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The title of the second
of Sympson’s works referred to for the gamba is “A

Simpson. London, 1660.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Brewer</span> was also a celebrated performer on the
gamba, who was born in 1611. He was admitted to Christ’s
Hospital at three years of age, and learnt the viol from his
music master. He composed various fantasias for his favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
instrument, besides airs, catches, rounds, as well as Pavins,
Courantes, &amp;c., for which kind of composition he seems to
have been noted.</p>

<p>The English gambists of the first half of the seventeenth
century must then have had some considerable reputation
abroad, for the Frenchman, André Maugars, already mentioned,
went about 1620 to London, lived there for nearly four years,
and perfected himself after the models of the best gamba
players. He does not seem to have had pupils. But his
compatriot and rival Hottmann<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> (or Hotteman) not only
taught, but distinguished himself especially by some charming
compositions. One of his most noted pupils was Marais
(Marin), born in Paris on the 31st of March, 1656. At first
a choirboy in the Sainte Chapelle, he educated himself
further under the direction of Hotteman, and then under
Sainte-Colombe, another excellent Parisian gamba player at
that time. Lully gave him instructions in composition.
In 1685 Marais became solo gambist at the Court Chamber
Music Concerts, which position he held until 1725. He died
August 15, 1728.</p>

<p>Besides Sainte-Colombe there were at that time two able
French gamba players&mdash;namely, Desmarets and Baisson.
Marais, however, excelled them in artistic execution. He
added to the six strings of the instrument tuned in the
accepted manner&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illt020.png" width="250" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p>also a seventh, the A of the “contra octave.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This
enabled him to surpass in harmonised playing all his
predecessors and contemporaries. He was the first who
caused the lowest strings of the gamba to be cased in metal
wire so as to give them greater tension and resonance, a step
in advance which was soon adopted for the two lower strings
of the violoncello. Besides some operas, Marais was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
author of a considerable number of gamba compositions
which appeared in five parts. The fifth of them, for one and
two gambas with a bass, was printed in 1705.</p>

<p>Out of his nineteen children, three sons and a daughter
devoted themselves to the study of the gamba. Amongst
them the most distinguished for his performances was</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roland Marais.</span> In the year 1725 he succeeded his father
as solo gambist at the Royal Chamber Music Concerts, the
prospect of which had been assured to him some years
previously. Quantz, who heard him in 1726, reported him as
a very skilful player. He published, in 1711, a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouvelle
méthode de musique</span>,” and in the years 1735 and 1738 two
volumes of gamba pieces with figured bass.</p>

<p>The Sainte-Colombe mentioned above had, besides Marais,
two noteworthy pupils, <span class="smcap">Rousseau</span> and <span class="smcap">Hervelois</span>. Jean
Rousseau perfected himself as a distinguished gamba player,
and was actively engaged in Paris during the second half of
the seventeenth century. He also made himself more
widely known by the production of two “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">livres de pièces de
viole</span>,” as well as a gamba school, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Traité de la viole</span>.” The
latter work appeared in Paris in 1687.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caix de Hervelois</span>, born about 1670, became, under the
direction of Sainte-Colombe, an excellent player, and after
further study entered the service of the Duke of Orleans. In
Amsterdam he had two books of his compositions published:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pièces pour la basse viole avec la basse continue</span>.”</p>

<p>Another French gambist of distinction in the seventeenth
century was Antoine Forqueray. He was born in 1671 in Paris,
and was one of the performers at the chamber music Concerts
of Louis XIV. Forqueray received instruction from his father.
At the age of five years he already excited the astonishment
of the king by his performances, who called him “his little
wonder.” In the year 1745, on June 28, he died at Nantes,
whither he had retired upon his pension.</p>

<p>His son, Jean Baptiste Antoine, born on April 3, 1700, in
Paris, was esteemed as the most able French gamba player of
his time. He also at five years of age was heard with such
favourable result before Louis XIV. that he later on became a
member of the royal music society. He again had a son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
whose christian name was Jean Baptiste, born about 1728,
who was also a gambist and published several books of
compositions for his instrument. He does not seem, however,
to have made himself conspicuous as a performer.</p>

<p>Gerber mentions in his musical Lexicon a Parisian
gambist of the eighteenth century of the name of Forcroix, or
Forcroy, “whose delightful playing Quantz, who was in Paris
in 1726, admired.” Possibly this artist may be identified as
the A. Forqueray mentioned above.</p>

<p>The art of gamba playing was pursued in Germany with as
great or perhaps greater zeal than in England and France.
While the pursuit of music by the English and French was
confined chiefly to London and Paris, there were in Germany
many courts who admired and cherished with fostering care
the art of music; and the result was, especially after the
tumult of the thirty years’ war had subsided, a widely-spread
musical life throughout the whole of the German
nation.</p>

<p>Amongst the first German players to be mentioned is <span class="smcap">David
Funk</span>, born about 1630, in the Saxon town of Reichenbach.
Gerber says of him, he was “an excellent musician and master
of the violin, the viola da gamba, the angelica,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the clavier,
and guitar”; and then goes on: “Funk was in every way a
genius. His chief study, which he carried to no small degree
of perfection, was that of the law. He was, besides, a wit
and a poet, and was reckoned among the good German
poets of that time. As a musician he was not only a virtuoso
on all the above-named instruments, but he was also a
composer, and won the applause of the public in a variety of
styles, for the church as well as for the chamber.... How
and where he had gained all these distinctions there is no
account. He was first known as a composer in the year 1670,
by the publication of his work on the gamba.” This enthusiastic
account emanated, according to Gerber’s report, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the precentor Joh. Martin Steindorf, of Zwickau, who was
personally acquainted with Funk.</p>

<p>In the year 1682 Funk gave up his appointment in
Reichenbach and accompanied the “East Friesland Princess”
into Italy as secretary, where he remained with his mistress
seven years. After her death there in 1689 he returned to his
native land, and, driven by the necessity of beginning again to
earn his livelihood, he had no other choice but to accept, at
“Wohnsiedel (Wunsiedel?), the miserable post of organist and
girls’ schoolmaster.” Funk’s dissolute character led him to
misuse his office as teacher to immoral purposes with the girls
entrusted to his care, so that he was compelled “by night and
fog to fly in order to escape the rage of the parents.”</p>

<p>From that time Funk led a vagabond life. He next betook
himself to Schleitz, and remained three months at the Court
there. Thence he was obliged to decamp as he was rigorously
pursued by the police of Wohnsiedel. He made his way to
Arnstadt, but did not reach that place. He was found one
day lying dead underneath a hedge.</p>

<p>At the same time as Funk, the virtuoso August Kühnel was
at work&mdash;born August 5, 1645, in the little town of Delmenhorst,
in Oldenburg. From 1695 to 1700 he lived at Cassel,
holding a position at the Court. During this time he
published “Sonatas or Parts for one or two Viole da gamba,
together with a bass, 1698.” According to Gerber, several
of his works should be in the Museum at Cassel. In composition,
Kühnel was a pupil of Agostino Steffani during his
residence in Hanover. His successor in office appears to
have been a certain Tielke,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> for he was from 1700 to 1720
gambist in the Cassel chapel.</p>

<p>Another gambist of the name of Kühnel (Johann Michael)
lived in the second half of the seventeenth century, and was
engaged at the Berlin Court. From here he went, in 1717, to
Weimar, and later on to Dresden, in the service of Field-marshal
Flemming. He seems to have ended his life in
Hamburg. Of his compositions there appeared at Rogers’s in
Amsterdam, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sonates à 1 et 2 Violes de gamba</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most important gamba players of Germany at the
end of the seventeenth and beginning of the eighteenth century
was Johann Schenk. As he appears to have had his second
work, “Konst œffeningen,” printed at Amsterdam in 1688,
consisting of fifteen sonatas for the gamba and bass, it may be
concluded that he was born about the middle of the seventeenth
century. Towards the end of it he was chamber musician in
the Elector Palatine’s service, which post however he must
have given up at the beginning of the eighteenth century, for
he is said to have settled in Amsterdam about that time.
Whether he remained there to the end of his life is doubtful,
for on the title-page of his sixth work, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzi musicali, per la
viola di gamba con basso continuo ad libitum</span>,” he calls himself
“Chamber Commissary and Chamberlain of the Elector Palatine.”
On the other hand, Mattheson informs us that he
(Schenk) was named inspector of the fish market, because he
had played the gamba so well! On the whole, he published
eight works, chiefly pieces and sonatas for the gamba, as well
as for the violin with a bass; a copy of the one, of which the
title is mentioned above, is preserved in the Royal Library
at Sondershausen. This comprehensive collection, consisting
of 101 musical pieces, is dedicated to the Elector Palatine
Prince William, consequently to the same art-devoted Prince
to whom Corelli, in the year 1712, dedicated his “Concerti
Grossi.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The title-page of the “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzi musicali</span>” bears no date, but
it maybe assumed that they appeared between 1692 and 1693,
for Schenk published his Op. 3 in the first and his Op. 7 in
the latter year, and the collection in question, as already
observed, bears 6 as the number of the work. The compositions
which it contains are grouped after the manner of
“Chamber Sonatas” or “Suite.” It is true that the author has
made use of neither of these terms, but the keys chosen
by him leave no manner of doubt as to the description
of instrumental compositions to which these “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Scherzi
musicali</span>” belong. We know that it was usual for all the
subjects of a suite at that period to be in the same key.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Looking from this point of view at Schenk’s work for the
gamba, it is apparent that it contains twelve suites or
chamber sonatas, of which some indeed are unusually long.
For example, the second suite (F major) and the fourth (A
minor) consist of fourteen pieces. Dances, such as Allemandes,
Courantes, Sarabandes, Gigues, Gavottes, and Minuets, make
up by far the greater portion of the volume. There are also
a couple of Bourrées; but then the composer gives also
Chaconnes and Passacailles with variations, which in some
cases are of great length, as well as Rondos and “Arias.”
The fourth sonata contains moreover a Canzone and an
“Allabreve”; the ninth, a Fugue; the eleventh, the same<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and
an Overture. The greater number of the suites begin with
a Prelude, though, on the contrary, the second begins with a
Fantasia, the fourth with a “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sonata con Basso obligato</span>,” and
the eighth with an “Overture,” the ninth with a “Capriccio,”
and the twelfth with a “Caprice.” The mode of writing alternates
from one to several parts, and the chords, by frequently
doubling the intervals, are extended to five notes struck
simultaneously. For the notation Schenk required four
different keys&mdash;viz., bass, alto, discant, and treble, by which
means the compass extends from
<img class="inline" src="images/illt025aa.png" width="99" height="75" alt="" />
to
<img class="inline" src="images/illt025ab.png" width="87" height="75" alt="" />
We conclude from this that Schenk, like the French gambist
Marais, used a gamba with seven strings, and, indeed, the
highest of them must have been tuned up to the one-lined G.
Schenk must have gone considerably above the seventh fret of
the fingerboard in order to reach the twice-lined B flat. With
regard to the artistically musical quality of Schenk’s compositions
for the gamba, they are mediocre; they bear no
comparison with the violin compositions of Corelli of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
period. He succeeded best in the dances, compared with
which the more elaborate productions appear poor and are in
some measure incorrect. Especially is this true of the two
so-called fugues, which do not rise above feeble attempts at
fugues. It is, however, interesting to know what position
Schenk took as one of the best reputed gamba virtuosos at
that time with regard to composition, for his productions give
an average idea of the executive capabilities of his contemporaries.
At the same time, Schenk’s works prove very surely
what double-stoppings, chords, and figures were possible on
the gamba, and in this respect reveal a remarkable richness
in various styles of playing.</p>

<p>Opposed to this by its simplicity in a technical point of
view is a “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sonata a Cembalo Obligato col Viol da Gamba</span>,”
by Handel. Double-stops and chords are altogether omitted.
It is true that he has quite another object in view, for Handel
treated the gamba not like Schenk, as a solo instrument,
but as subsidiary only to carry out a musical idea, thus
placing it on a level with the clavier. He chiefly uses also
the middle positions of the gamba in the alto key throughout.
Otherwise this Sonata,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> though solid in form, is of small
importance, and gives the impression of a composition
quickly thrown off for some special occasion.</p>

<p>Handel’s great contemporary, Joh. Seb. Bach, treated this
instrument, in his three sonatas composed for it and the
clavier, in quite another manner. It is true that with rare
exceptions he makes no use of the scored and harmonised
technique for the gamba; but the artistic and complete mode
of working out by which all his instrumental works are more
or less distinguished is also peculiar to the gamba sonatas
just mentioned, of which the most important are the first in
G major and the third in G minor.</p>

<p>Charmingly and with characteristic effect did Bach employ
the gamba in his Passion Music from the Gospel of St.
Matthew and St. John, as well as in some of his Cantatas.
One has only to recall the splendid, deeply touching alto aria
“It is finished,” in the Passion Music of St. John. Now at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the performance of this sublime work the gamba part in the
aria referred to is played by the violoncello, which does not
quite express the deeply melancholy, pathetic tone that Bach’s
music was designed to express. But there is no more appropriate
substitute in the modern orchestra for the gamba than
the violoncello.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of Joh. Seb. Bach is that, with a rare
knowledge of art, he made use for his purpose of all the
instruments current in his time which adapted themselves in
any way to the representation of a special effect. But he
further conceived the idea of enriching the choir of instruments
by an invention of his own. During his work at Köthen he
constructed the “Viola Pomposa,” a stringed instrument of
the cello kind, though, like the violin, for the hand, which
had five strings tuned to C, G, d, a, ē&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/illt027a.png" width="312" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Gerber remarks concerning it: “The limited way in which the
violoncello in Bach’s time was handled compelled him, for the
quick basses in his works, to the invention of the so-called
viola pomposa, which, rather longer and higher than a
tenor, had a fifth string, e, in addition to the four lower
strings of the violoncello, and was placed on the arm.
This convenient instrument enabled the player to execute
more easily the high and rapid passages which occurred.”</p>

<p>It may be seen from Bach’s Suites for Violoncello Solo,
which were originally written for the viola pomposa, the
compass of this instrument extended from the great octave C
<img  class="inline" src="images/illt027ba.png" width="154" height="75" alt="" />
to the thrice-accented G
<img  class="inline" src="images/illt027bb.png" width="110" height="75" alt="" />
However,
the “Viola pomposa” did not attain to general use. It scarcely
survived its inventor, and disappeared, as it seems, even before
the gamba, out of the musical sphere.</p>

<p>Bach’s eldest son, Philipp Emmanuel, also wrote for the
gamba. Amongst other things a sonata in three movements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with the clavier, in G minor,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> which was apparently composed
about 1759. The three-part movement in this is solid, though
somewhat meagre and dry.</p>

<p>Amongst the gamba compositions of the previous century,
which have lasted up to our time, there is also to be noted an
unpublished Concerto by Joseph Tartini, the famous founder
of the old Paduan violin school, with accompaniment for four
stringed instruments and two horns.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Possibly Tartini wrote
it during his three years’ residence in Prague (1723-1726) for
a German gambist, as about that time the gamba was still
cultivated in Germany with great enthusiasm, though it had
been, in Italy, thrust into the background of music by the
violoncello. The Concerto bears all the marks of the
author’s manner of expression, but it is in the main quite as
antiquated as all his violin concertos. The introduction and
<i>Finale</i> are in G; the “Grave” between the two movements is
in D minor. The single part theme of the solo, with the exception
of a few double-stoppings and chords, is throughout written
in tenor and bass clef. It is worthy of remark that all the
pieces are provided before the full close with cadences, written
at full length, for the solo instrument, after Tartini’s usual
manner in all his violin concertos.</p>

<p>As a contemporary of Schenk, the War Minister of Hesse-Darmstadt,
<span class="smcap">Ernst Christian Hesse</span>, who was born on the 14th
April, 1676, in the Thuringian town of Grossengottern, distinguished
himself. Gerber says of him, that he was the first and
most famous gambist of his time in Germany. Having spent
his school years at Langensalza and Eisenach, he entered the
Darmstadt chancery service as supernumerary and followed
the Court of his new master in 1694 to Giessen. At the
Academy there he continued his work and also his legal
studies. In 1698 he had permission from the Court to go to
Paris in order to perfect himself there on the viol da gamba,
which he had already begun to study in early life. He
remained there three years and had instruction at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
time from the two famous masters, Marais and Forqueray.
As privately they were at enmity with each other he was
compelled to give his name to one as Hesse and to the other as
Sachs. Both were delighted with his skill and progress, and
severally boasted of the excellent pupil whom he had taught.
At last they challenged each other to put to the test, in a
concert arranged for that object, the proficiency of their
pupil. But what was their astonishment on Herr Hesse’s
appearance to find he was the pupil of both! He did his
two masters, each in his own manner, special credit, but
immediately after the occurrence left Paris.</p>

<p>After his return to the Darmstadt Court, in the year 1702,
Hesse was named Secretary of the War Department and
Foreign Office. In the following year he married.</p>

<p>In the year 1705 Hesse travelled through Holland and
England, and two years later he betook himself to Italy, in
order to increase his knowledge in the art of composition.
Everywhere his gamba playing excited the greatest admiration.
On his return journey from Italy he visited Vienna and was
heard at Court, together with Hebenstreit, famous in his time
as the inventor of a dulcimer-like instrument, called Pantaleon.
The Emperor was so charmed with his playing that he presented
him with a gold chain and his portrait. In the year 1713 he
lost his wife. About the same period the vacant post of Kapellmeister
at the Darmstadt Court was given to him <i>ad interim</i>.
He then married his second wife, the famous singer,
Johanna Eliz. Doebbrecht (Döbricht), and in 1715 he was
promoted to the post of War Commissary and eleven
years later to the dignity of Minister of War. “In 1719,”
says Gerber, “Hesse made another musical tour with his
wife to Dresden, to the famous festivals held in honour of the
Elector’s marriage and where several operas by Lotti and
Heinichen were represented. They both gained extraordinary
honour and abundant appreciation. From this time he
devoted himself quietly to the Court until his eighty-sixth
year, and died May 16, 1762, after he had participated in
every kind of good fortune. Besides the airs which he
arranged for the church during the time that he filled the
Kapellmeister’s vacancy, he left behind him many Sonatas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and Suites for the Viola da gamba, which fully bring out all the
possibilities of this instrument.”</p>

<p>Hesse had twenty children, only eight of whom, however,
survived him. His eldest son, Louis Christian, became,
under his father’s tuition, a clever gambist, and entered as
such into the service of the Prince of Prussia in 1768.</p>

<p>Besides his son, Hesse formed the excellent gamba player,
<span class="smcap">Joh. Christ. Hextel</span>, born 1699, in the Swabian town of
Oettingen. His father, who was Kapellmeister to the
Prince of Oettingen, and then worked in the same capacity at
the Ducal Court of Merseburg, wished that the boy should
study, and entered him, in 1716, at the University of Halle.
Here he occupied himself by preference with music, and when
he returned home he gained his father’s permission to devote
himself exclusively to the art. The Duke of Merseburg
announced his willingness to grant him the means of pursuing
his studies either in Paris, under Marais and Forqueray, or
at Darmstadt, under Hesse’s direction. The young Hextel
himself decided for Hesse, who took him as a pupil under exceptional
conditions. After two years’ study he left Darmstadt,
performed at concerts at the Courts of Eisenach, Merseburg,
Weissenfels, Zerbst, and Köthen, and accepted a post in the
Eisenach Kapelle. During the years 1723-27 he was travelling
in Germany and Holland; played in 1732 before Frederick
the Great at Ruppin, while he was still Crown Prince; and
then undertook the post of Concert Director at Eisenach.
When, after the death of its prince (1742), the Eisenach
band was dissolved, through the recommendation of Franz
Benda he was appointed Concert Director at the Court of
Strelitz. He filled this place until 1753, and died a year after.
Of his numberless compositions only six sonatas for violin
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">solo e continuo</span>,” 1727, were published at Amsterdam.</p>

<p>As noteworthy German gambists belonging to the first half
of the eighteenth century must be mentioned&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emmerling</span>, <span class="smcap">Hard</span>, and <span class="smcap">Bellerman</span>. The former of these,
born at Eisleben, was in the year 1730 Chamber Musician and
Viola da Gambist to the Margrave Louis of Brandenburg, and
also, as Gerber says, instrumental composer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joh. Daniel Hard</span>, born May 8, 1696, in Frankfurt on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Main, remained at the outset of his musical career for five
years in the service of King Stanislaus during his residence
at Zweibrücken, and then was Chamber Musician to the Bishop
of Würzburg and the Duke of Franken, Joh. Phil. Franz von
Schönborn. After four years he gave up this service and took
a post as Chamber Musician at the Wurtemburg Court. Later
on he again became Concertmeister and finally Capellmeister
to the Duke Carl Eugene. He still filled this office at
Stuttgard in 1757. Further accounts of him are wanting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constantine Bellerman</span>, “Imperial Crowned Poet” (poet
laureate), as Gerber calls him, studied as amateur gamba
player. He was born in 1696 at Erfurt, there studied law,
and also pursued music theoretically and practically, playing
the lute, gamba, violin, and flute. He was called to Münden
as Cantor, and then, in 1741, as Rector of the School there.</p>

<p>Of his many unpublished compositions, there are amongst
them Church pieces, Cantatas, an Opera, Suites for the lute,
Concertos for the Oboe d’Amour and the Flute, Clavier
Concertos with violin, and Overtures; here only six Sonatas
for Flute, Gamba, and Clavier will be noticed. The year of his
death is unknown.</p>

<p>Amongst the German gambists of the first half of the
eighteenth century a lady held a prominent position, <span class="smcap">Dorothea
v. Ried</span>, one of the five daughters of the Austrian musician,
Fortunatus Ried. Johann Frauenlob says of them, according to
Gerber, in his Essay on Learned Women: “That although
two of them were still very young&mdash;one was scarcely eight
years old&mdash;their father had brought them on so well in music
that with their two brothers they had given at Vienna, Prague,
Leipsic, Wittenberg, and other places such evident proofs of
their talent as to have excited universal admiration, for
people thought they heard heavenly rather than earthly
music.”</p>

<p>Here also must be mentioned a royal personage&mdash;namely,
the Elector <span class="smcap">Maximilian Joseph</span>, born March 28, 1728; died
December 30, 1777. He played the violin and the cello, but
was especially an excellent gambist. Burney, who heard him
in 1772, says that he needed not to be a great prince in order
to discover that his skill, his rendering of adagio, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
accuracy in time were perfect. Maximilian also composed.
His teacher for composition was Bernasconi.</p>

<p>Finally, <span class="smcap">Carl Friedrich Abel</span> must also be mentioned as a
gambist of the first rank. He was born at Köthen, 1725, where
his father held the appointment of gamba player in the Hofkapelle.
“The young Abel,” says Gerber, “seems to have had
instruction, as Thomas’ scholar, at Leipsic, from the great
Seb. Bach; then came in 1748 to the Hofkapelle at Dresden,
where, during the more flourishing period of Hasse’s life, and
for nearly ten years, he found time enough to form his taste.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
His small salary and a split with the director Hasse caused
him to leave that Court, according to Burney, in 1758, with
three thalers in his purse. In order to increase this capital,
he went on foot to Leipsic, laden with the MS. of six
symphonies, where, through the generosity of the publisher
of these symphonies, he became six ducats richer. He now
went from one German court to another, and, by repeated
good receptions and applause, he regained not a little confidence.
Finally he turned to London, in 1759, where he found
a great patron in the lately deceased Duke of York, who
supported him until the formation of the Queen’s Band, to
which he was appointed in the capacity of chamber musician,
receiving an annual payment of £300.</p>

<p>“This salary was considerably increased by the music dealers
giving him a stipulated sum of £150 for six symphonies.
His duty at the Queen’s Concerts was generally to play the
tenor on his gamba, and now and then, in the absence of
Bach,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> to accompany on the piano. For some years he lived
in Paris during the summer, where he found in the house of a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fermier-général</i> not only a friendly reception, but also what he
liked better than all, the best of wine. On his first appearance
in London, his discretion, his taste, and his pathetic
manner of expression in the rendering of his adagios so
captivated the young virtuosi that they very soon followed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
school, with less expenditure of notes and with more successful
result. His taste and knowledge especially made him the
umpire on all contested points, so that he was looked upon in
all difficult cases as an infallible oracle. With his dexterity on
the gamba he also possessed the talent, like many other older
virtuosi, of exciting the astonishment and admiration of his
hearers by free fantasias and learned modulations. And
although he had considerably less power on the harpsichord,
yet he knew how to modulate in arpeggio with consummate
skill and in endless changes.”</p>

<p>“Abel remained in London until 1782, in which year the
desire of once more seeing his brother and his country induced
him to return to Germany. It was on this journey that he
displayed, both at Berlin and Ludwigslust, the greatness of
his talent, his wonderful power of expression, the richness of
his tones, and his stirring execution on the gamba. The
present king, then Crown Prince of Prussia, before whom he
performed in Berlin, presented him with a costly casket and
100 louis d’or. A few years later he stayed some time in
Paris on account of the disordered condition of his finances.
But he returned again to London and died there on June 22,
1787, after a three days’ lethargy, without the least suffering.
Shortly before his death he played a recently finished solo
which astonished his warmest admirers. His cadences especially
were excellent.”</p>

<p>It is remarkable that, amongst Abel’s numberless published
works, which consist partly of concertos and orchestral pieces
and partly of chamber music, there are no compositions for
the gamba. This must be explained by the fact that the
zenith of gamba-playing had been reached, and the art was on
its decline, at the beginning of the second half of the eighteenth
century. It went out of fashion, and with it also gamba
music, and in its place only violoncello compositions were
in request. In many ways this change was as much lamented
as was the case at the banishment of the lute to cabinets of
curiosities or the lumber room.</p>

<p>After Abel there were no German gambists of conspicuous
importance to mention. From the middle of the last century
the gamba was more and more neglected, in consequence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the violoncello being brought forward, and the younger
geniuses devoted themselves by preference to this instrument,
which approached more nearly to the violin, then at the
summit of all instrumental music.</p>

<p>Amongst stringed instruments, which had shared the same
fate as the gamba, belong the Viola bastarda and the Viola
di Bordone (English, Barytone). The first instrument was in
shape somewhat thicker than the gamba and was provided
with six or seven strings.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In order to increase the resonance,
as many steel strings were introduced under the fingerboard
and bridge, which were tuned to the same pitch as those
above, like the Viola d’amore. Another variety of the gamba
was the barytone, which was cultivated in the last century.</p>

<p>In Leopold Mozart’s violin tutor is found the following
description of it: “This instrument has from six to seven
strings like the gamba. The neck is very broad and the back
part hollow and open, down which nine or ten brass or steel
strings are run beneath, which are touched and pinched by
the thumb; so that, at the same time as the principal part is
played with the bow on the upper cat-gut strings, the thumb
by striking the strings stretched under the neck of the
instrument can play the bass; and therefore the music
must be arranged specially for it. Moreover, it is a most
agreeable instrument.” From this description it is evident
that the barytone was a bass instrument resembling the
Viola d’amore. The barytone in its time was much liked in
Austria. Several Austrian composers, as Cybler, Weigl, and
Pichl, and at their head Joseph Haydn, composed for this
instrument. The latter was incited to it by his benefactor,
the Prince Esterhazy, who looked with particular favour on
the barytone. Haydn wrote no less than 175 pieces for it.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
The tuning of the strings on the fingerboard of the barytone
was on the same principle as that of the gamba.</p>

<p>The Viennese, <span class="smcap">Anton Lidl</span>, who was born about 1740, was
much esteemed as a most distinguished barytone virtuoso.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Gerber says of him, “that he rendered still more perfect his
instrument, which had been invented about the year 1700.
It is in shape like the Viola da gamba, except that it has
brass strings at the back, which are played at the same
time with the thumb. These lower strings he increased
to twenty-seven and the semitones were played with them.”
He must have been an extraordinary artist on this instrument.
The author of the <cite>Almanack</cite> of 1782 says: “His
performance united the most charming sweetness to German
vigour, the most surprising syncopations with the most
harmonious melody.” According to Burney, Lidl was no
longer living in 1789. Up to 1783 he had published, in
Amsterdam and Paris, Duets, Quartets, and Quintets&mdash;altogether
seven works. His compositions for the gamba
were not published.</p>

<p>The barytone disappeared with the gamba, in the course
of the second half of the last century, from musical
practice.</p>

<p>The same change took place in Italy about the same time
or somewhat earlier, when a lively interest in the violoncello
was aroused there by Franciscello, of whom we shall speak
farther on. It appears, indeed, that in the land of the arts, as
the quotations already given from Maugars’ papers inform us,
no predilection had prevailed for the higher study of the gamba,
either for the reason that among stringed instruments the
cultivation of the violin&mdash;which from the seventeenth century
had decidedly usurped the first place in the study of music&mdash;was
chiefly pursued, or that the Italian composers did not
specially concern themselves with the gamba. As a matter
of fact, so far as can be perceived, with the exception of
Tartini, no noteworthy Italian composer considered it worth
his while to bring it into the field of creative activity.
Besides Ferabosco, of whom mention has already been made,
there are amongst famous Italian bass violin players and
gambists to be named: Allessandro Romano with the cognomen
“della Viola,” and Teobaldi Gatti. <span class="smcap">Romano</span> was born about
1530 at Rome, and in 1560 was a singer in the Papal
(Sixtine) Chapel. He later became a monk of the monastery
of Mount Olivet, under the name of Giulio Cesare. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
did not find his sojourn there agreeable, for he was at strife
and contention with one or other of the monks of his order
through incompatibility of temper. His compositions,
published between the years 1572-1579, consist of “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Canzone
alla Napolitana</span>” for five voices and a book of Motets in
five parts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teobaldi Gatti</span>, born at Florence about 1650, not only
distinguished himself as a gamba player, but also made
himself known in his time as an operatic composer. In the
latter respect he was influenced by Lully, whose first
opera-overtures so impressed him that he resolved to go
to Paris in order to do homage to his illustrious countryman.
Lully, who was flattered, showed his gratitude for
this attention by making Gatti a member of the Parisian
Opera orchestra, which post he filled for nearly fifty years
uninterruptedly.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> He died in 1727, in Paris. There were
published in 1696 twelve “Airs Italiens” by him, two of
which are duets.</p>

<p>As skilful Italian gambists are conspicuous also <span class="smcap">Marco
Fraticelli</span> and <span class="smcap">Carlo Ambrosio Lunati</span>,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of Milan, with the
cognomen “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il gobbo della Regina</span>.” The latter came to
England during the reign of James II. Nothing further is
known concerning either of these instrumentalists. It is
worthy of remark in this place that the famous Italian singer,
Lenora Baroni, born about 1610, was, according to Maugars’
testimony, a clever theorbo and gamba player. As such she
was in the habit of accompanying herself in singing.</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that the viola da gamba,
which for nearly three hundred years (for the “Basso di viola,”
or Gerle’s “great violin,” was, in fact, a gamba, although as yet
of a somewhat primitive form) had played an important part
both as an orchestral and solo instrument, was replaced by
the violoncello in the course of the eighteenth century.
Subsequently when the violin as a leading instrument in melody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
usurped the place of the cornet (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zinken</span>), and the discant
viola (French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par dessus de viole</span>), it became necessary to
provide an equivalent for the bass part of string quartets, as
the tone of the gamba in <i>ensemble</i> playing proved too weak and
thin in proportion to the violin.</p>

<p>Mattheson says of it, in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neu eröffneten Orchestre</span>,”
which appeared in 1713: “The plaintive Viola da gamba
(Fr., Basse de Viole, properly so called) is a beautiful delicate
instrument, and he who wishes to signalise himself on it must
not keep his hands long in his pockets.... Its chief use in
concerts is only for the strengthening of the basses, and some
indeed pretend to execute a ‘Thorough Bass’ on it, of which,
up to now, I have never seen a good attempt.”</p>

<p>In opposition to this last somewhat sarcastic remark of
Mattheson is what Gerber states a hundred years later (Vol.
I., p. 6, of his “New” Musicians’ Lexicon) concerning the
gamba. He there says: “It is remarkable in the history of
music that his (Abel’s) instrument was buried with him in
the year 1787 in total oblivion: the indispensable gamba,
without which for a hundred years neither church nor chamber
music could be arranged, which in all public and private
concerts had the exclusive right to be heard before all other
instruments from the beginning to the end, and which therefore,
like caskets, must not only be exquisitely finished in
every size, large and small, but was also ordered, bought,
and paid for adorned with the most costly artistic carving&mdash;ivory,
tortoiseshell, gold, and silver&mdash;then available. In the
course of time there will be no vestige left in the whole of
Europe of this instrument, once so universal and admired;
henceforth it will have to be sought for amongst the old woodcuts
in Prätorius, or specimens of it, stringless and worm-eaten,
in a royal music chamber. Another sad proof how
greatly Apollo is overruled by the goddess Fashion. The
taste of our forefathers for these soft, modest, humming
viola tones is also remarkable; they were a quiet, contented,
peace-loving people! In the present time the instruments for
our musicians cannot be chosen sufficiently high and shrill.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
It is plain that although Gerber himself played the cello, this
instrument was also known to him, and he had not only
remarked the disproportion between the tone of the violins and
those of the gambas in the orchestra with regard to strength,
but also the circumstance that, by the creative faculty of
Haydn and Mozart in the region of higher instrumental
music, the gamba had become wholly superfluous. The
superior qualities of the violoncello to the gamba as a solo
instrument had escaped him, although the conspicuous
success of cello players in the second half of the last century
could not have remained unknown to him. It seems, therefore,
as if Gerber had a special predilection for the gamba&mdash;a taste
which only a few of his contemporaries shared with him.</p>

<p>Gerber’s<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> confident assertion that the French priest,
Tardieu, of Tarascon, had invented the violoncello “in the year
1708,” is simply to be relegated to the region of fable, for
the instrument had already existed long before in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Fétis remarks (p. 47) in his article “Antoine Stradivari”
(Paris, 1856): The violoncello had already been mentioned
by Prätorius in his “Syntagma Mus.” (1614-1620), which is a
mistake, for the work referred to contains neither the name
nor the illustration of this instrument.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> But the violoncello
must already have been in use about this time in Italy, for
(according to Rob. Eitner)<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> it is mentioned in a publication of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the year 1641, and then in a work of Freschi’s, which appeared
in 1660 as “Violoncino.” In Arresti’s Sonatas in two and three
parts, of the year 1665, it is called “Violoncello.” It was of
great importance for the Italian instrument makers to produce
a bass instrument of the violin type which had already been
in use from the middle of the sixteenth century, and this
certainly happened towards the end of that period. This is
proved by the Brescian Gaspard da Salò<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> (1550-1612).
Whether Andreas Amati, the founder of the famous Cremona
school (born 1520, died 1580), constructed similar instruments
appears doubtful. Apparently the gamba as well as
the violin served as guides for the proportions in the construction
of the violoncello. From the violin were borrowed
the outlines of the soundbox, the arched back, which the
more ancient gambas, whose backs were flat, did not have;
also the F holes and the fingerboard without frets. From
the gamba were taken the large proportions of the violoncello.
It was at first constructed like the gamba, in smaller and
larger dimensions, until Stradivarius established a standard
size. Whether the most famous German violin maker,
Jacob Stainer (born 1621, died 1683), made violoncellos is
much doubted by experts. It is, however, certain that
he made gambas, which were often converted into violoncellos.</p>

<p>According to Eitner’s previously mentioned assertion, it
appears that the last-named instrument was at first called “Violoncino,”
and a little while after “Violoncello.” The Italian
affixes “ino” and “ello” have a diminutive meaning, and
therefore both names have an identical signification. As violino
is the diminutive of viola, violoncino and violoncello are the
diminutives of “violone.” The tenor of our day, which also at
that time sprang from the alto or tenor viola, after the pattern
of the violin, received the name of Viola da braccio, which
means “arm viola.” Besides the Viola da braccio there was
also a “Viola da Spalla,” which was not placed beneath the
chin, but rested on the left shoulder. Concerning this bass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
instrument Mattheson remarks: “The Viola da spalla, or
shoulder-viola, has a particularly grand effect in accompaniment
from its penetrating and pure tone. A bass can never be
more distinctly and clearly brought out than by this instrument.
It is fastened by a ribbon to the chest and thrown over the
right shoulder, but has nothing which can stop or prevent in
the smallest degree its resonance.”</p>

<p>To return to the violoncello. It offered the player two
very important advantages over the gamba. First, the
finger technique was wholly unlimited because the fingerboard
had no frets, which, in regard to runs and cadences,
as well as change of positions, opposed a substantial
hindrance to the gamba player. Then the player on the
violoncello could obtain more tone than on the gamba,
by drawing the bow more forcibly over a single string.
The upper edge of the bridge of the gamba, over which
the strings passed, was so flatly cut for harmonised or
part-playing that it was necessary to avoid a strong tone, lest
the neighbouring strings should be thereby sympathetically
affected. But the bridge of the cello, on the contrary, was of
a more convex form, whereby playing in parts was indeed
precluded. As is known, on the cello as on the violin, only
double stops and chords are possible, and the last only broken
up. In this manner the violoncello was used formerly at the
performances of operas and oratorios as solo accompaniment
of recitatives, for which of course it was requisite that the
player should have a thorough knowledge of music theoretically,
as he had to execute at sight figured basses.</p>

<p>Corrette gives already in his violoncello tutor (1741) instructions
for accompanying recitative. These directions are,
however, by no means exhaustive; such are first found in
the cello tutor compiled for the Paris Conservatoire by De
Baillot, Levasseur, Catel, and Baudiot, which appeared in print
in 1804. Therein it is said:</p>

<p>“In order to accompany well a recitative, a complete
knowledge of harmony and of the violoncello is necessary;
one must be intimate with figured basses, and know how to
execute them readily. He who can do this has reached the
summit of art; for it presupposes a great deal of necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
information, and still more the power of judging how to turn
it to account.</p>

<p>“If the bass player is not certain of the resolutions of
discords, if he is unable positively to indicate to the singer
when he is to make a complete or a broken cadence, if in his
concords he does not know how to avoid forbidden fifths and
octaves&mdash;he is in danger of confusing the singer, and in any
case he will produce a most disagreeable effect.</p>

<p>“As in good compositions, a recitative always follows a well-defined
progression and adapts itself to the character of the
part, to the situation portrayed, and to the voice of the singer:
in the accompaniment&mdash;1. The strength of the tone must be
regulated according to the effect to be produced, for the
accompaniment must sustain and embellish the singing and
not spoil and drown it. 2. The chord must not be repeated,
except when the harmony changes. 3. The accompaniment
must be quite simple, without flourishes or runs. Good
accompanying always has in view the best rendering of the
subject, and when the player allows himself to fill up certain
gaps with a short interlude, this must only consist of the
notes of the chord. 4. The chord must be played without
Arpeggio, ordinarily in the following manner”&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 402px;">
<img src="images/illt041.png" width="402" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Baudiot in his violoncello tutor, which appeared later
than the above, makes the following remark concerning
the accompaniment of recitative: “It sometimes happens
that the actors linger on the scene without reciting (speaking),
be it that they have forgotten the text of what they have to
recite, or that for some other reason they are silent. At
times their appearance on the boards is delayed. In such
cases, the accompanist (<i>i.e.</i>, the cellist) can perform short
preludes and embellishments at his pleasure. But he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
be modest about it, and employ his ornaments at the right
moment, and always with taste.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>To the art of violoncello making the same applies as to the
violin. The productions of the Italian makers surpass those
of all other nations. Amongst them, those manufactured by
Nicholas Amati, Stradivari, and Gius. Guarneri del Gesù are
most to be preferred and justly so.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Stradivari and Amati made their cellos of two different
sizes; the larger one was formerly called “il Basso,” while
the smaller was distinguished as the Violoncello proper. The
latter is the more preferable as being more manageable; in
these days it is used as a valuable model.</p>

<p>As to the violoncello bow, which had the following form in
the first half of the eighteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> its progress went
hand in hand with that of the violin bow. The improvements
which were successively made on the latter were effected on the
former. The greatest perfection reached by the bow was the
work of a Frenchman, François Tourte. To this day he has
never been excelled in this department. (See Appendix <a href="#A">A</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p>The fabrication, however, of good violin and cello bows has
latterly become very general; and especially in Markneukirchen
the manufacture of bows as well as instruments has
received a great impulse.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p class="p2 center">Violoncello.</p>


<p>In the seventeenth century the violoncello still occupied a
very subordinate and modest position; during the period
mentioned, with very few exceptions, it was employed only as
a bass instrument in the orchestra. At the beginning of the
eighteenth century, however, there was already a great
change; for Mattheson says in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neu eröffneten Orchestre</span>,”
which appeared in 1713:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap lowercase">PROMINENT</span> Violoncello, the Bass Viol, and the Viola
da Spalla are small bass fiddles (viols) similar to the
larger ones, with five or six strings, on which can be played all
kinds of quick things, variations and movements much more
easily than on the larger machines” (Mattheson means the
contra-basso).<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>It is, therefore, quite conceivable that some time was
necessary, before the players, who were unaccustomed to the
undivided fingerboard of the cello, were sufficiently confident
of a finger technique differing so completely from that of the
gamba. They were at first limited to the lower part of the
fingerboard, as was the case primarily with the violin.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The
position of the thumb, by means of which the higher and
highest positions on the fingerboard could alone be fixed and
maintained with certainty, could hardly have been known
before the beginning of the eighteenth century. The violoncello
at this time, as appears from Mattheson’s account just
mentioned, had sometimes a set of five or even six strings like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the gamba. On the five-stringed instruments the tuning
was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/illt046.png" width="203" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Abbé Tardieu already referred to, who played the violoncello,
according to Gerber, had the same tuning on his
instrument. About the third decade of the last century,
those who used five-stringed instruments gave up the highest
string&mdash;(the D). From that time the four-stringed instrument
with the tuning C, G, D, A came very generally into use.
The latter was not altogether a novelty. Prätorius mentions
it in his “Syntagma Mus.” as the “Bass Viol de Braccio.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>In Germany the use of the violoncello as an orchestral
instrument ensued later than in Italy, though much sooner than
in France. For although it had been introduced into the
Parisian Opera in 1727, by the cellist Batistin, to be mentioned
later on, it had been already in use since 1680 in the
Vienna Hofkapelle. The Saxon Hofkapelle at Dresden
next followed by the installation of four violoncellists. Their
names are Daniel Hennig, Agostino Antonio de Rossi, Jean
Baptiste José du Houbondel, and Jean Prach de Tilloy.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> As
two of these players have French names, it is to be assumed
that the violoncello had already found representatives in
France at the beginning of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The example set by Vienna and Dresden was soon imitated
also by other German Courts. The band of Duke Charles
Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp affords a case in point. As this
prince, the future son-in-law of Peter the Great, found
himself obliged, in 1720, to reside at the Russian Imperial
Court, his private musicians followed him thither, amongst
whom there was a cellist.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>As the gamba enjoyed a great amount of favour<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Germany, the introduction of the violoncello was not
effected without difficulty, to which indeed the gambists,
who thought their pretended rights were thereby infringed,
not a little contributed. For in a paper which appeared
in 1757 in the French language, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Observations sur la
Musique</span>,” &amp;c., it is said: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La seule basse de viole a déclaré
la guerre au violoncelle qui a remporté la victoire et elle a
été si complète que l’on craint maintenant que la fameuse
viole, l’incomparable sicilienne ne soit vendue à quelque
inventaire à un prix médiocre et que quelque luthier profane
ne s’avise d’en faire une enseigne</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>It was not quite so bad as the last words of the announcement
lead one to suppose. Even if the violoncello caused the
gamba to be quite superfluous in the orchestra, the latter was
cultivated as a solo instrument for some time longer, and many
of the good old gambas were in course of time metamorphosed
into violoncellos, and made available for further use; while the
more insignificant specimens were destroyed, if they were not
required for completing instrumental collections and so
preserved from destruction.</p>

<p>The art of violoncello playing in the first stages of its
development was, as regards the method of treatment, not so
much favoured as violin playing. To the latter a definite
direction for imitation was early given, as soon indeed as the
end of the seventeenth century, by the Roman school
founded by Arcangelo Corelli, which was soon followed by the
foundation of the Paduan and Piedmontese schools.
Violoncello playing lacked such classical parent schools.
When a few prominent artists of this instrument had brought
it into greater consideration, centres were formed by
distinguished masters for the study of the cello, which
supplied the want of proper schools, about which we shall
have more to say farther on.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand how it followed that the violoncello
was first valued in the land of its birth&mdash;that is, in Italy, not only
as an orchestral instrument but also for solo playing. How
this important branch of art was there developed we shall see
in the next section.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;ITALY.</h3>


<p>Italy has the claim of priority in violoncello as well as
violin playing. It was the birthplace of the violin and of the
cello, and from thence emanated the artistic executive
development of both instruments. The first famous Italian
cellist of whom we have any notice is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Domenico Gabrieli</span>, with the surname of <span class="smcap">Menghino del
Violoncello</span>, born about 1640 at Bologna, died in 1690. This
artist found a sphere of work in the church of San Petronio
in his native town. Then he entered the service of Cardinal
Pamfili in Rome. Gabrieli was also a composer of some
repute. Fétis mentions eight of his operas which were
written partly for Bologna and partly for Venice. His other
works consist of a “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cantata a voce sola</span>,” in a collection of
Motets, entitled “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vexillum pacis</span>,” for alto solo and instrumental
accompaniments, as well as “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Baletti, gighe,
correnti, e sarabande a due violini e violoncello, con
basso continuo</span>” (Op. 1). These three works, of which the
last is a reprint, appeared successively in 1691, 1695, and
1703, consequently after Gabrieli’s death. He appears to
have composed nothing specially for the cello.</p>

<p>More remarkable as a cellist must have been <span class="smcap">Attilio
Ariosti</span>, the Dominican monk, born at Bologna in 1660.
Gerber at least says of him that he was one of the most excellent
violoncellists of his time. But he was also a distinguished
performer on the Viola d’amore. He occupied himself chiefly,
however, with opera compositions, for which the Pope granted
him a dispensation from the rule of his order, as without it,
being a Dominican, he was forbidden to meddle with anything
connected with the theatre. In 1698 Ariosti was sent for to
Berlin as Kapellmeister to the Elector of Brandenberg.
Thence he went in 1716 to London, where, in the proximity
of Handel, he could make no way, and therefore at last
returned to his fatherland. He chose Bologna as his place
of residence. Like Gabrieli, he appears to have produced
no independent<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> violoncello compositions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>His fellow-country man, <span class="smcap">Giovanni Battista Bononcini</span>
(Buononcini),<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> famous as an able cellist, also devoted his
talent by preference to the operatic stage. He was the eldest
son of the choirmaster, Giov. Maria Bononcini, at the church
S. Giovanni, in Monte, at Modena, and was born in 1672, or,
according to Fétis, in 1667 or 1668. At first instructed in
music by his father, and then perfected by Colonna at
Bologna, he betook himself, at twenty-two or twenty-three
years of age, to Vienna, where he found a post as cellist in the
Imperial Kapelle. Here he turned to opera, which at that
time was a favourite means of entertainment for the seeing
and listening public, and promised more reputation and gain
than all other kinds of composition.</p>

<p>Fétis mentions twenty operas by Bononcini, but he doubtless
wrote more. Even in his eightieth year he was occupied
for the theatre in Venice. Besides, he wrote an Oratorio,
“Joshua,” several orchestral pieces, masses, chamber duets,
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trattenimenti da Camera</span>,” &amp;c., some of which were
composed before his entrance into the Vienna Hofkapelle.
He also wrote “Sinfonie” for violin and violoncello as well as
cello solos. Of the latter there appeared at J. Simpson’s
(London) a sonata for two violoncellos in a collection of
sonatas by Pasqualini, San Martino, Caporale, Spourni, and
Porta. As Caporale was born in 1750 and Porta in 1758, the
publication of this collection must have taken place late in
the second half of the eighteenth century. The Bononcini
sonata contained in it does not give a very favourable
impression of this composer’s talent. The development is dry
and in places very formal, even here and there somewhat
incorrect. To the two figured parts are given accompanying
basses, partly simple and partly contrapuntal. The interest
which attaches to this composition, consisting of an <i>Allegro</i>,
with introductory <i>Andante</i>, a movement marked “<i>Grazioso</i>,”
and a “<i>Minuet</i>,” after which the “<i>Grazioso</i>” is to be repeated,
rests chiefly on the light which it throws upon the technical
condition of cello playing at the beginning of the eighteenth
century (for doubtless the composition belongs to that period).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
In reference to this is to be remarked: the principal part is
confined chiefly to the middle tones; the lower ones are only
occasionally touched, and the compass of the higher notes
reaches to the one-lined A; the thumb position does not
come into use. Figure is little developed, and only
modest attempts are made at playing double stoppings
and chords; the notation is in tenor and bass clefs.</p>

<p>It is reported that during Bononcini’s residence in Paris,
between 1735-1748, he composed a Motet with cello obbligato
accompaniment, for the royal band there, which last he
himself played at the performance of his work in the presence
of the king.</p>

<p>Alessandro Scarlatti,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the founder of the Neapolitan opera
school, had given an example of this use of the violoncello about
twenty-five years before in one of his cantatas. Geminiani,
Corelli’s pupil, related that this cello part was performed
during Scarlatti’s presence in Rome, and with his assistance
on the clavier, by the famous violoncellist, Franciscello
(Francischello); his playing was so beautiful that Scarlatti
described it as heavenly.</p>

<p>This event must have occurred in the year 1713, when
Scarlatti was in Rome the last time. Consequently, Franciscello’s
birth must be placed with all probability in the year
1692. He would have been twenty-one years of age when he
played with the Neapolitan master.</p>

<p>Gerber says that Franciscello went from Rome to Naples in
1725. That he was actually there in the year mentioned is
affirmed by Quantz, who himself heard him play. Through
Franciscello’s extraordinary performances the violoncello
was soon so generally accepted in Italy, that the gamba
had, in 1730, almost entirely disappeared from the Italian
orchestras.</p>

<p>In the year 1730, Franciscello was summoned to Vienna as
Imperial chamber musician, a proof that his name had already
penetrated beyond his country. Franz Benda, afterwards
celebrated as a violinist, and founder of the Berlin violin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
school, heard him in the Austrian capital. Franciscello’s
manner of playing so impressed him that he took him from
that time as his model.</p>

<p>Franciscello remained, it appears, ten years in Vienna. If
a notice in the “Musical Almanack for Germany, of the year
1782,” is to be credited, he had already been a member of the
Imperial Court and Chamber Music Society in 1766, which is by
no means beyond the bounds of possibility, though not very
probable. We hold then to the assumption that he was born in
1692 so that, in 1766, he would be already seventy-four years
old. It is not known where Franciscello closed his life.
Tradition only says that at an advanced age he resided in
Genoa, to which the supposition was attached that that city
had been his birthplace. It is stated that the elder Duport,
the cello virtuoso, who was born in 1741, went from Paris to
visit him there.</p>

<p>During his long period of work at Vienna, Franciscello
doubtless instructed pupils in cello playing; who
they were is however, as little known as the question
if or what he composed for his instrument. On both points
we are no better off than concerning his somewhat older
compatriot</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cervetto</span>, called <span class="smcap">Jacopo Bassevi</span>, who was born in 1682.
Until his forty-sixth year he remained in his fatherland.
Then, like so many other Italian musicians of this time, he
was seized with a desire to travel, and betook himself to
London. There he trafficked at first in instruments which
he had brought with him from Italy; this, however, was so
little remunerative that he very soon gave it up, and joined the
orchestra of Drury Lane Theatre. According to Burney’s
judgment, Cervetto was, for his time, a very clever violoncellist,
who knew how to manipulate the fingerboard with
much dexterity; but his tone must have been rough and
harsh. Of his eccentricity the following anecdote is an
illustration: Once when the famous Garrick was representing
a drunkard and sank down senseless upon a seat, Cervetto
broke upon the sudden stillness with an unseemly loud
and long-drawn yawn. Garrick immediately got up, severely
censuring such behaviour, upon which Cervetto pacifying
him answered: “I beg your pardon, I always yawn when I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
very pleased.” A few years later Cervetto became Director
of Drury Lane Theatre, and thus he laid the foundation of
his fortune.</p>

<p>Cervetto must have had a very strong constitution, for
he lived to the unusual age of 101 years. His death took
place on January 14, 1783. He left a fortune of £20,000
sterling, which he bequeathed to his son James, who was
also a cellist; but soon after inheriting from his father he
retired into private life. He, also, reached a respectable age,
for as he came into the world (in London) in 1747, and died
February 5, 1837, he was ninety years old. In 1783 he was
performing at the Court concerts of the Queen, as well as
taking part in the musical <i>réunions</i> in the house of Lord
Abington as one of the best reputed cellists in London. Of
cello compositions he published: 1. Twelve “Solos for a
Violoncello, with a Thorough Bass for the Harpsichord”; this
work, dedicated to the Elector Palatine of Bavaria and Jülich-Eleve-Berg,
appeared at the author’s own expense, without
date. 2. “Six Solos for a Violoncello, with a Thorough Bass for
the Harpsichord, Opera Terza.” London. 3. “Twelve
Sonatinas for a Violoncello and a Bass, Op. 4<sup>ta</sup>.” London.
Fétis adds, besides, “Six solos <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour la flûte</span>” and “Six trios
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour deux violons, et violoncelle</span>,” which must have been in
existence not long before the end of the last century. We
shall have occasion to refer again farther on to Cervetto’s
violoncello compositions.</p>

<p>Taking up again the chronological thread, after Cervetto the
elder, the cellist Batistin, whose real name was <span class="smcap">Joh. Baptist
Struck</span>, must be mentioned. He was of German origin and
was born in Florence in the second half of the seventeenth
century, from thence he went to Paris at the beginning of the
eighteenth century. He there entered the band of the Duke
of Orleans and the opera orchestra, in which he, conjointly
with the brothers Abbé (properly Philippe Pierre and Pierre
de Saint-Sévin), played the cello parts. He must have
performed well, since Louis XIV., in order to retain him in
the French capital, gave him a liberal allowance and, in
addition, a sum of 500 francs for certain theatrical compositions
to be supplied by him. Besides this he wrote a
long list of ballets and operas specially for Court festivities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
There appeared in print, by him, during the years 1706 and
1714, in Paris, four books of “Cantatas” and a collection of airs.
He does not appear to have composed for the violoncello.
He died on December 9, 1755, at the scene of his work.
Among the masters of the Neapolitan school, <span class="smcap">Leonardo Leo</span>,
at that time the famous opera composer, distinguished himself
as a violoncellist, who was born, 1694, at S. Vito degli Schiavi,
in the province of Lecco, and died at Naples in 1746. He
also composed six cello concertos with quartet accompaniments,
which belong to the years 1737 and 1738. The MSS.
of these are in the Library of the Royal Conservatoire at
Naples. It is supposed that these are the oldest of existing
cello concertos.</p>

<p>Another Italian cellist of that time was <span class="smcap">Domenico della
Bella</span>, of whom nothing further is known than that, in 1704,
he published, in Venice, Twelve Sonatas “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">a due violini e
violoncello</span>.”</p>

<p>The information is equally meagre regarding the cellist
<span class="smcap">Parasisi</span>, of whom Gerber says he was an extraordinary
artist on his instrument and was with the Italian Opera
orchestra at Breslau in 1727.</p>

<p>Concerning the Italian violoncellists <span class="smcap">Jacchini</span>, <span class="smcap">Amadio</span>,
<span class="smcap">Vandini</span>, <span class="smcap">Abaco</span>, <span class="smcap">dall’Oglio</span>, and <span class="smcap">Lanzetti</span>, born in the second
half of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth
century, we know very little.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jacchini</span>, whose Christian name was Giuseppe, noted by
Gerber as one of the first cellists of his time, was appointed
to the church of S. Petronio in Bologna at the beginning
of the eighteenth century. That he had distinguished
himself as an artist is proved by his nomination as
a member of the Bologna Philharmonic Society, a distinction
which is only conferred on men of great musical reputation.
Of his compositions there is a work entitled “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Concerti per
Camera a 3 e 4 stromenti, con violoncello obligato (Op. 4).
Bologna, 1701</span>,” to be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pippo Amadio</span>, who flourished about the year 1720, was,
according to Gerber’s account, a violoncellist, “whose art
surpassed all, that up to his time had been produced on his
instrument.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antonio Vandini</span>, first violoncellist at the church of S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Antonio, Padua, seems to have been no less remarkable.
The Italians called his manner of playing and his expression
“parlare”&mdash;he understood how to make his instrument speak.
He was on terms of such close friendship with Tartini, who as
is known was engaged at the same church at Padua as solo
violinist, that he accompanied him in 1723 to Prague, and
remained with him for three years in the service of Count
Kinski. Vandini was still living in Padua in 1770. The year
of his death is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abaco</span>, born at Verona, according to information contained
in the second year of the “Leipsic Musical Paper” (p. 345), was
a prominent violoncellist, who lived in the first half of the
eighteenth century. Gerber possessed a cello solo of his
composition, of which he says that it appeared to have been
written in the year 1748.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giuseppe dall’Oglio</span>, the younger brother of the famous
violin player, Domenico dall’Oglio, was born about 1700 at
Padua,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and went to St. Petersburg in 1735. There he
remained in the Russian imperial service twenty-nine years,
after which he returned to his native land. On his journey
thither he stopped at Warsaw, on which occasion King
August of Poland nominated him his agent for the Venetian
Republic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salvatore Lanzetti</span>, born at the beginning of the eighteenth
century in Naples, was pupil of the Conservatorio there,
Santa Maria di Loreto, and was during the greater part of
his life in the service of the King of Sardinia. He died in
Turin in 1780. In the year 1736 two volumes of violoncello
sonatas appeared by him, and later also a book of instruction,
the title of which Fétis gives as: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Principes du doigter pour le
Violoncelle dans tous les tons</span>.” It is somewhat differently
named by Gerber: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Principes ou l’applicatur de Violoncel
par tous les tons</span>.” Lanzetti must have carried out with
great skill the staccato touch both up and down the
instrument.</p>

<p>We are somewhat better informed regarding the violoncellist
<span class="smcap">Caporale</span>. Neither the place of his home nor the year of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
birth nor that of his death are, indeed, known to us, but of his life
and work in England we possess some information. In 1735
he came to London and worked under Handel, who wrote for
him a cello solo in the third act of his opera “Deidamia”
composed in 1739.</p>

<p>His musical education could not have been very thorough,
but he must have had certain qualifications which induced
Handel to connect himself with him. Simpson’s Collection
(see p. <a href="#Page_49">49</a>), published in London, contains a Cello Sonata by
Caporale, which does not speak much for his talent in
composition. It consists of <i>Adagio</i>, <i>Allegro</i>, and a <i>Theme</i>
with three variations after the manner of studies. As a player
Caporale was remarkable for his tone, but as regards finish he
could not rival either the elder <span class="smcap">Cervetto</span> or <span class="smcap">Pasqualini</span>.</p>

<p>This last-named artist, by whom a sonata, scarcely rising
above the level of Caporale, was contained in the volume
already mentioned as appearing at Simpson’s, was performing
in London, in 1745, as a concertist of great repute. Further
information regarding him does not exist.</p>

<p>Greater consideration must be yielded to <span class="smcap">Carlo Ferrari</span>,
brother of the violinist Domenico Ferrari, so often referred to
in the previous century. On account of an injured foot he
was called “the lame.” Born at Piacenza about 1730 he
betook himself to Paris in 1758 and appeared with great success
in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concert Spirituel</span>.” In 1765 he accepted an engagement
offered to him by the Count of Parma.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> He remained in this
position until his death, which took place in 1789. It is
reported of Ferrari that he was the first Italian cellist who
made use of the thumb position. If this be true, France
must have been beforehand in the difficult matter of the art
of fingering; for the thumb position was already known in
Paris, as we have seen, before 1740, consequently at a time
when Ferrari was only ten or twelve years old. But if it be
acknowledged that violoncello playing was cultivated much
earlier in Italy than in France, and had already advanced
beyond the elemental stage before it had found representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
among the French, we must be inclined to concede to the
Italians the discovery of the thumb position, and indeed to
the predecessors of Ferrari. It is highly probable that
Franciscello and Batistin already availed themselves of its
assistance for the use of the upper parts of the fingerboard.
The trick must have been brought into France by the last-named
artist who, as we know, settled in Paris at the
beginning of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The proof that the thumb position was known in Paris
before 1740 is established by the violoncello method of Michel
Corrette in the year 1741, and which, as far as one can see,
was the first work of instruction for the instrument in question.
Considering the scarcity at that time of cello compositions this
instruction book is the more important, as from it is to be
determined with certainty the average standard to which violoncello
playing had attained towards the middle of the previous
century. This circumstance seems to justify our entering
somewhat more fully into Corrette’s school.</p>

<p>The title is: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méthode, théoretique et pratique, pour
apprendre en peu de temps, le violoncelle ... dans sa perfection
composée par Michel Corette. XXIV<sup>e</sup> Ouvrage à Paris, chez
l’auteur, M<sup>e</sup> Boivin et le S<sup>r</sup> le Clerc; à Lyon chez M. de
Bretonne. Avec Privilège du Roy. MDCCXL1.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>After some introductory paragraphs regarding the use of the
F and C clef, in notation for violoncello music, concerning
the value of notes and pauses, the formation of sharps, flats,
and naturals, as well as regarding the usual marks, the
various measures and syncopes, Corrette treats:</p>

<p>1. Of the manner of holding the violoncello; 2. Of the
holding and action of the bow; 3. Of its use in the up and
down strokes; 4. Of the tuning of the violoncello; 5. Of the
division of the fingerboard into diatonic as well as chromatic
tones; 6. Of the fingering in the lower (first) and following
positions; 7. Of the way and manner of returning from the
higher positions to the first; 8. Of trills and appogiaturas;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
9. Of the various kinds of bow action; 10. Of double-stops
and arpeggios; 11. And also of the thumb position.
He also gives instruction for those who wish to go from the
gamba to the violoncello, and then in conclusion gives
hints for the accompaniment of singing and for instrumental
solos.</p>

<p>It is evident that the directions of Corrette have chiefly a
mere historical importance, as the technique of the violoncello,
after the appearance of his method, underwent
substantial changes. His explanation concerning the finger
positions of that period and the thumb position which in the
higher parts of the fingerboard takes the place of a moveable
nut, concerning the manipulation of the bow, and the
considerations to be observed in exchanging the gamba for
the violoncello have a special interest for us.</p>

<p>With regard to the first of these four points, we remark
that the finger position adopted by Corrette for the diatonic
scale on all the strings was, in the first two positions,
1, 2, and 4; in the “third position,” 1, 2, 3, 4; and in
the “fourth,” 1, 2, and 3; after the latter position the
fourth finger was as a rule no longer needed, for which
Corrette adduces as a reason that it is too short to be made
use of in the higher positions of the fingerboard; in case
however it should be necessary to use it, the use of the left
arm would be impeded. In exceptional cases, says Corrette in
another part of his school, the fourth finger could be used in
the “fourth position,” without altering the thumb position, for
the B flat and B on the A string, for the E flat on the D string, for
the A flat on the G string, and for the D flat on the C string. The
finger positions were then, in the first half and about the
middle of the last century, somewhat different in the diatonic
scale of the violoncello than they were later on. It is
especially to be remarked that the E and the B were touched
with the second finger upon the two lower strings, though the
notes marked were far more convenient for the third finger,
which very shortly took the place of the second.</p>

<p>As to the exclusion of the fourth finger, when playing
with the thumb position, no proof is needed to show the
reason was that it gave an awkward manner of holding the
left hand. The finger positions for the chromatic scale still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
more widely differed from the fingering employed later, as
the following scale shows&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illt058a.png" width="500" height="172" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It very nearly happened, that as early as the seventeenth
century when a stringed instrument was so much desired as
a standard one for the violoncello, that the violin mode of
fingering was adopted for the former, which according to the
foregoing remarks really was the case, with the exception of
the use of the third finger. It had however been overlooked
that the cello, on account of its much larger dimensions,
demanded an entirely different method of fingering. The
regulation of this important point, which offered peculiar
difficulties, occupied cellists up to the beginning of our century.
In some measure the fingering which Corrette teaches for
descending intervals of a second from the higher to the lower
tones is unavoidable. He gives the two following examples&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illt058b.png" width="500" height="202" alt="" />
</div>

<p>He gave the preference to the second example.</p>

<p>The almost total exclusion of the fourth finger caused a very
great restriction in playing with the thumb position. But
when Corrette wrote his work this limitation would hardly
have been felt, as the higher parts of the fingerboard were
little, and, only in exceptional cases, used by cello players and
composers. Corrette mentions, as the highest tone, the one-lined
B. Caporale and Pasqualini do not go beyond this note
in their sonatas, already mentioned, excepting in one instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
when Caporale casually uses the two-lined C. It appears
that, with many cellists, in place of the thumb the
first finger was made use of in the higher positions as a
support, for Corrette remarks concerning his method: “If the
first finger is used instead of the thumb the fourth finger must
necessarily be made use of; it is, however, on account of its
shortness, really useless in the upper ‘positions.’” To
beginners Corrette recommended the attempt then in vogue&mdash;but
a little later combated by Leopold Mozart in his violin
school<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>&mdash;to introduce marks on the fingerboard indicating
the intervals in order to learn to play clearly in tune.
For gamba players who, following the spirit of the time, gave
up their instrument and turned to the violoncello, which was
rapidly coming into use, this means of assistance had a
certain value, accustomed as they were to the frets of the
gamba fingerboard, for the finger positions of both instruments
differ considerably from one another, as appears from
the comparison given below by Corrette.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p>The figures placed under the gamba scale relate to the frets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
which are to be attended to by the player, while those of the
cello scale are the finger positions to be used.</p>

<p>The lower C, which the string itself forms on the cello, had
on the gamba to be touched at the third fret; the succeeding
D on the gamba was the open string, while on the cello it was
to be touched with the first finger, and so on.</p>

<p>The four highest tones, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>a</i>, fell in the gamba on the
2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 7th frets, whereas, according to Corrette’s
account, those in the cello required the use of the thumb
position. It is plain that the gamba players who took up
the violoncello had to adopt an entirely different system
of fingering.</p>

<p>To a certain extent the handling of the bow presented
difficulties to those who exchanged the gamba for the
violoncello. The former instrument, on account of the flatness
of the bridge, did not allow of an energetic use of the bow.
From the violoncello, on the contrary, a powerful tone must be
brought out, which had to be learnt by gamba players.
Besides, they had also to accustom themselves to other
strokes of the bow for the cello. What was played by the
latter instrument with a down stroke, was played by an
upward one on the gamba, and the reverse.</p>

<p>The holding of the bow was again rather different from
the present manner. Corrette gives three ways for this.
According to Corrette’s testimony, the most usual way in
Italy consisted in placing the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th fingers
upon the rod and the thumb beneath it, so that the bow
was held not exactly at the nut, but about a hand’s
breadth from it, as formerly and even at the beginning of
our century was done by many players. The second way
of holding the bow was, the other four fingers being
placed as above, to lay the thumb upon the hair. Finally,
the bow was also held, so that the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th
fingers were laid upon that part of the rod to which the nut
is attached, while the thumb had its place beneath the nut.</p>

<p>Corrette does not give the preference to either of these ways
of holding the bow, which in the course of the second half of
the last century became more and more obsolete. He was of
opinion that they were all good, but left it to each one to
choose the manner in which the most power could be attained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
It seems, however, noteworthy that Corrette laid it down as
a rule that the middle of the bow should be used in playing,
whereby its use was limited to a third of its length.</p>

<p>In the preface to his method Corrette speaks of several
systems amongst violoncellists, but adds, the best and most
generally followed was that of Bononcini, of which also the
most skilful masters in Europe made use. From this remark
it follows, that in the composition of his school, he took
Bononcini’s manner of playing, which he was able to study,
soon after the latter’s arrival in Paris, as his guide. In
surveying the above principles, detailed by Corrette, regarding
the technique of violoncello playing, it must be admitted that,
needing improvement in almost every respect about the
middle of the last century, it had not progressed, with few
exceptions, beyond the elementary stages. The chamber
sonatas and suites of Joh. Seb. Bach for violoncello solo, the
last of which were originally composed for the Viola pomposa,
cannot be cited as proofs to the contrary. In them Bach
forestalled the technical capacity of his time by a decade.
Although they are composed for that part of the fingerboard
on which there is no question of the thumb position, yet they
contain difficulties of an extraordinary kind which Bach’s
contemporaries had not been able to master.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> And even in
the second half of the last century there could have been no
cellist who would have been fully capable of playing them.
Therefore it must be considered either, that these compositions,
so remarkable of their kind, were not absolutely
composed for the cello; or that the violoncello technique
took another direction, which was called out by these suites
of Bach.</p>

<p>The violoncello, like the violin, is primarily an instrument
for the voice. As such it was chiefly used by
the Italians, who, up to the second half of the last century,
gave the impulse to stringed instrument playing. This is to
be gathered from the cello pieces by Italian composers
belonging to this period. As instances, next to the sonatas
already mentioned, two musical pieces of the same kind may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
be cited, by San Martini (Giov. Battista Sammartini)<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and
Bernardo Porta.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Neither of these composers were violoncellists.
Their sonatas are, however, adapted to the nature
of the instrument for which they were composed. As
compositions they are indeed of little importance, and as
regards the technique, they do not rise above the measure of
the modest demands which were then required.</p>

<p>With regard to cello technique the younger Cervetto, whose
compositions have already been mentioned, p. <a href="#Page_52">52</a>, goes
really farther. In them there is a greater variety in the
manner of playing, in the use of double-stops and different
passages derived from the scale and the chord. Such ways
of playing could naturally only at first be found out and
perfected in a proper manner by those who were already
experienced practised players on an instrument of extreme
difficulty on account of its extensions.</p>

<p>The cello pieces of Cervetto formed after the manner of
Tartini’s violin sonatas are, as to their contents, quite
antiquated, and are only interesting in a purely technical
point of view. Like the compositions already considered,
they occupy mostly the parts of tenor and bass. Only
twice in the first <i>Allegro</i> of the tenth Sonata of his Op. 4
does Cervetto venture to the twice-lined E, and at the conclusion
of the same piece to the twice-lined A. In both
cases he has to use the treble clef, which does not appear
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Besides Cervetto the younger, amongst Italians who cultivated
cello playing must be mentioned Gasparini, Moria, Joannini
di Violoncello, Zappa, Cirri, Aliprandi, Graziani, Piarelli,
Spotorni I. and II., Barni, Bertoja I. and II., Lolli,
Sandonati, and Shevioni. We give below the meagre
information which exists regarding them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quirino Gasparini</span>, a distinguished cellist, was in 1749
Kapellmeister at the Court of Turin. He remained there
until 1770. As a composer, he was chiefly occupied with
church music, no cello pieces are known by him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Moria</span>, the fact only is known that, in 1755, he was heard
at the “Concert Spirtuel” in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joannini di Violoncello</span>, from the year 1759 Kapellmeister
at St. Petersburg, had a great reputation in his own country
as a player.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Zappa</span>, called <span class="smcap">Francesco</span>, according to Gerber was making
a concert tour in 1781, and “enchanted his hearers in
Dantsic by his soft and delightful execution.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giambattista Cirri</span>, born in the first half of the eighteenth
century, at Forli, lived and worked for a long time in England.
On the title page of his first work, published at Verona in
1763, he called himself a “Professore di Violoncello.” Of his
compositions there appeared in print seventeen different
works in London, Paris, and Florence.</p>

<p>As a clever violoncellist, <span class="smcap">Bernardo Aliprandi</span>, son of the
opera composer, Aliprandi, born in Tuscany, was distinguished.
His father was composer and Court band-conductor in Munich
during the first half of the previous century; but he himself
became a member of the orchestra there, where he still was in
1786. His cello pieces, of which several were published,
are as obsolete as those of Cirri.</p>

<p>Gerber, in his dictionary, says of <span class="smcap">Graziani</span>, that after the
death of the gamba player, Louis Christian Hesse,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> he was
summoned to Potsdam to take his place as tutor to the Crown
Prince of Prussia. When the French violoncellist, Duport
(the elder), came to Berlin, in 1773, Graziani lost his post at
Court. He died at Potsdam in 1787. The six violoncello
solos, Op. 1 (printed in Berlin about the year 1780), as well
as the six cello pieces brought out in Paris (Op. 2), mentioned
by Gerber in his old Musical Dictionary under the name of
Graziani, must have appeared in the latter years of the
author’s life.</p>

<p>In the second half of the last century there was a violoncello
virtuoso, by name <span class="smcap">Piarelli</span>, who, about 1784, had printed in
Paris six violoncello solos. This is all that is known about
him.</p>

<p>Of the brothers <span class="smcap">Spotorni</span>, Gerber only says that, in 1770, in
Italy, “their native land, they were esteemed as violoncellists.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>A very skilful player was <span class="smcap">Camillo Barni</span>, born on
January 18, 1762, at Como. He received his first instructions
in cello playing at the age of fourteen years from his grandfather,
David Ronchetti. Later on, Giuseppe Gadgi, Canon of
the Cathedral at Como, taught him for a few months. At
the age of twenty Barni joined the opera orchestra of Milan,
of which he became first violoncellist in 1791. In the year
1802 he went to reside permanently in Paris, where he
appeared as solo player, and then, for several years, was an
active member in the orchestra of the Italian Opera. Between
1804 and 1809 he published several duets for his own instrument
and the violin. He also wrote a cello concerto.</p>

<p>Concerning the brothers <span class="smcap">Bertoja</span>, Gerber only says that both
were employed in Venice about 1800, as virtuosi on the
violoncello, and were reputed in Italy the first masters of their
instrument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Filippo Lolli</span>, son of the violin virtuoso, Antonio Lolli, was
born at Stuttgard, in 1773; practised the cello from early
youth, and at eighteen years of age made a concert tour,
which led him to Berlin. Here he was heard by the King,
who was so pleased with his performance that he recognised
it by an honorarium of 100 louis d’or. Lolli then went
to Copenhagen, and in the year 1804 played at concerts
in Vienna. There is no more information about him
extant.</p>

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Sandonati</span>, Gerber says that he lived in Verona in 1800,
and was one of the most renowned violoncellists of those
times. Gerber announces the same of the Mantuan, <span class="smcap">Shevioni</span>,
who worked about the same time apparently in Verona.</p>

<p>While all these men were endeavouring to make an advance
in violoncello playing, and especially in violoncello compositions,
the Italian nation possessed in Boccherini an artist who
surpassed in every direction his countrymen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luigi Boccherini</span>, the son of a contra-basso player, was
born on February 19, 1743, at Lucca. He there received his
first musical instruction from the archbishop’s choirmaster,
Vanucci. Besides the cultivation of theory, he devoted
himself with peculiar zeal to cello playing, of which he was
to prove a master. The very promising progress which he
made decided his father to send him to Rome for the further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
prosecution of his studies, and where his talents attained
their full development.</p>

<p>When Boccherini, after the course of a few years, returned
to his native town, he found there Tartini’s pupil, Filippo
Manfredini, his countryman, who was an excellent violinist.
He soon formed an intimate friendship with him, which led
to an arrangement for making a concert tour. The two
artists went to Spain, afterwards to Piedmont, to Lombardy,
and the South of France. The favourable reception which
the friends experienced encouraged them about 1768 to
proceed to Paris. In the French capital they had a splendid
success. The compositions of Boccherini gained such great
applause that the Parisian music publishers, La Chevardière
and Venier, declared themselves ready to undertake the
expense of printing all the works already heard. Notwithstanding,
he received very little for his compositions, and
later on he was not more fortunate.</p>

<p>At the persuasion of the Spanish ambassador in Paris
the artists proceeded, at the end of 1768, or the beginning
of the next year, to Madrid. Here Boccherini roused
the special interest of the Infanta Don Luis, who named him
his “Compositore e virtuoso di camera.” When this prince
died, on August 7, 1785, Boccherini became Court Kapellmeister
of King Charles III. of Spain, a post which he also
filled under the succeeding king, Charles IV. He received a
still further recognition from the King Frederick William II.
of Prussia, who designated him his chamber-composer, when
he, in the year 1787, dedicated a work to this art-loving
monarch, who conferred on him a considerable honorarium.
From that time Boccherini dedicated to him everything that
he composed. We may conclude that he was adequately
remunerated, for when the king died in November, 1797, and
the allowance ceased, Boccherini fell into difficulties, his compositions
being badly paid by the publishers. At the same
time he seems to have lost his place as Kapellmeister to the
King of Spain. However it was, he spent the last years of his
life with his family in great need, from which death only
released him on May 28, 1805.</p>

<p>Having in view the great quantity of his compositions,
Boccherini must be distinguished as an extremely prolific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
composer. There are in existence 400 instrumental works by
him. They consist of 20 symphonies, 125 string quintets&mdash;amongst
them are 113 for two cellos, of which the first cello
is more or less an obbligato&mdash;91 string quartets, and numberless
trios, septets, quintets with flute or oboe, violin sonatas, as
well as several vocal compositions for the church, &amp;c.
Very little has proved capable of surviving, and this little only
awakens a limited interest. The cause of it seems to be in
a certain simplicity which underlies all Boccherini’s music.
With great cleverness of form, added to an apt and easy
flow, it is certainly not wanting in originality, which has
even a humorous tendency; but the manner of expression is
characterised by a certain formality which gives to Boccherini’s
music an antiquated air. His ideas are wanting in power of
thought and depth of feeling; they rarely rise above the
pleasing and agreeable.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the century the chamber compositions
of Boccherini had an extraordinary popularity, especially
amongst the <i>dilettanti</i>. From that time, however, they
have been little played, at least in Germany. The interest
in them was maintained much longer in France, where they
were unusually prized, according to Fétis’s “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie
Universelle des Musiciens</span>.” There also they have been
for some time laid on one side.</p>

<p>Boccherini composed six concerti specially for the violoncello.
There are also extant several cello sonatas with bass
by him. It is surprising that there is no mention made of
them in the list of Boccherini compositions by Fétis. Six of
these sonatas have been republished on the one hand by
Friedrich Grützmacher, and, on the other, by Alfred Piatti, with
piano accompaniment. The violoncello concerti of Boccherini,
on the contrary, have fallen almost entirely into oblivion.
They are only so far interesting in that by them is shown to
what degree of technique cello playing was developed by this
master. We must here observe that he was one of
the first of the Italian school who gave decided expression to
the solo and virtuoso side of his instrument. He not only
made possible for cello music the higher and highest parts of
the thumb position, with the exception of the complicated
harmonics first discovered and made available after his time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>,
but he also considerably extended beyond his predecessors
the playing of double stops as well as the execution of
passages.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>If in form they were somewhat superficially elaborate and
worked out after the manner of studies, yet instructive
material for practice of an extent and variety hitherto
unknown was provided for cellists. For Italy it was a
sensible loss that Boccherini spent the greater part of his
life abroad, his native land was in consequence deprived of
the advantage which the personal influence and example
of his strikingly artistic proficiency might have gained.
If he had remained there he would, doubtless, have been to his
countrymen as regards cello playing what Corelli and Tartini
were to Italian violin playing. But under the prevailing
conditions Italy lacked a recognised musician who might have
been the means of further successfully developing that
branch of art. Moreover, the decided preference of the
Italians for opera from the end of the last century, which
prevailed to the cost of all other musical efforts, checked
for a time further impulse to or demand for the cultivation
of stringed instrument playing, which until then had been so
successfully pursued on the Apennine Peninsula. What,
however, Italy’s sons attained in the art of violoncello playing
was not lost, but was further perfected by German and French
masters, concerning which the following sections will give the
necessary explanation.</p>




<h3>II.&mdash;GERMANY.</h3>


<p>The Violoncello had already found its place as an orchestral
instrument about the year 1680 at Vienna, and in 1709, in
the Dresden Royal orchestra, as we saw. Towards 1720 it had
penetrated also into Northern Germany, since the band of
the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp evidently possessed one. At the
same period this stringed instrument must have been extensively
used in other parts of Germany&mdash;otherwise Joh. Seb.
Bach would scarcely have conceived the idea of composing for
it his solo sonatas, which were already extant between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
years 1717-1724. There were even at that time two German
violoncellists who appeared to Gerber of sufficient importance
for him to give them a place in his Dictionary of Music.
Their names are: Triemer and Riedel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Sebald Triemer</span> was born at the end of the seventeenth
or the beginning of the eighteenth century, in Weimar,
where he was instructed in instrumental playing by the
Ducal Chamberlain and Musician, Eylenstein, and in the
theory of music by Ehrbach, an old musician of Weimar. As
soon as Triemer had made progress sufficient to figure as a
soloist, he undertook a concert tour which led him to
Hamburg, for, in 1725, he was a member of the theatre
orchestra there. Two years after he went to Paris, and
remained until 1729. During this time he pursued the study
of composition under the direction of Boismortier.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> He then
went to the Dutch city of Alkmaar, and, later on, to Amsterdam,
where he died in 1762. At Amsterdam he had six “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sonate a
Violoncello solo e continuo</span>” published.</p>

<p>The Silesian, <span class="smcap">Riedel</span>, was not only a cellist, but also chief of
the Fencing School at Liegnitz. He must have been a very
good player for his time. About 1727 he went to St. Petersburg,
and was there the instructor of the <span class="smcap">Emperor Peter II.</span>
(who, as is known, only reigned three years&mdash;1727-1730),
both in cello playing and in fencing.</p>

<p>Riedel was also member of the Russian Court band, where
he still was in 1740.</p>

<p>The number of German violoncello players very soon
increased. Amongst them, Werner must next be mentioned,
born at the beginning of the eighteenth century in Bohemia,
and died in Prague, 1768. He must have been a most
excellent player, since, as Gerber says, in his time no foreign
cellist ventured to play in Prague. Werner was for some
time established at the Crusaders’ Church, in Prague. Of
his numberless concertos and solos for violoncello, none
seem to have been printed.</p>

<p>The violoncellist, <span class="smcap">Caspar Cristelli</span>, born in Vienna at the
beginning of the eighteenth century, was, in 1757, chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
composer in the service of the Archbishop of Salzburg. He
specially distinguished himself as an accompanist, a talent
at that time highly prized, for the cellists who accompanied
the vocal recitatives played an important part. Cristelli also
wrote several compositions for his instrument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Baptist Baumgärtner</span>, born 1723, in Augsburg, died
May 18, 1782, at Eichstädt, as chamber virtuoso of the Prince
Bishop, was educated in Munich, and then made a concert
tour through Germany, England, Holland, and Scandinavia.
Besides some violoncello concertos he wrote: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Instruction de
musique théoretique et pratique a l’usage de violoncelle</span>.” This
instruction book appeared in 1774 or 1777, at the Hague.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wenzel Himmelbauer</span>, born 1725, in Bohemia, was in
Prague in 1764; went, however, to Vienna, and had a good
reputation as cellist. His playing was chiefly famed for
firmness of the bow stroke and quickness at sight reading.
C. F. Daniel Schubart remarks of him in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ideen zu einer
Aesthetik der Tonkunst</span>”: “He was a sincere and a most
agreeable violoncellist, without any artistic pride; a man of
the most upright and amiable heart”; and he further
remarks: “No one uses his bow so quietly and easily as this
master. He executes the most difficult passages with the
most extraordinary ease, and especially pours out his heart in
the <i>Cantabile</i>. His sweet expression, his delightful phrasing,
and, moreover, his great power in the middle tints are the
wonder of all connoisseurs and hearers.” He composed little
for his instrument, but this little has all the more intrinsic
value.</p>

<p>Of Himmelbauer’s compositions there appeared at Lyons,
1776, as Op. 1, duets for flute or violin and violoncello. A
few duets for two violoncellos remained unpublished. The
MS. was, in 1795, in the possession of the Bohemian cellist,
Emeric Patrzik, and later fell into the hands of the author of
“The Art Lexicon for Bohemia,” G. J. Dlabacz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philipp Schindlöker</span> must be mentioned as a noteworthy
pupil of Himmelbauer’s. Born on October 25, 1753, at Mons,
in Hennegau, he went very young to Vienna, whither his
parents betook themselves. There he began the study of the
violoncello. In 1795 he was appointed solo violoncellist at
the Royal Opera House, Vienna, and three years later to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
orchestra of the Cathedral, S. Stephan. In the year 1806 he
received the title of Imperial Chamber Virtuoso. He died
April 16, 1827. Sixteen years previously he had already
retired into private life. Of his compositions only a serenade
for the Violoncello and Guitar was published. The rest,
consisting of a Concerto, Sonatas with bass accompaniment,
and a Rondo also with bass accompaniment, remained
unpublished.</p>

<p>His nephew, <span class="smcap">Wolfgang Schindlöker</span>, born in 1789 at
Vienna, was educated by him as a clever cellist. After he
had been heard at fourteen years of age at a concert, he went
in 1807 as chamber musician into the service of the Court at
Würzburg. His compositions consisted of a “Grand duo”
and three Duets, which were published.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Franz Joseph Weigl</span> belonged to the best German cellists
of the last century; he was the father of the opera composer,
Joseph Weigl, formerly in much repute. He was born on
March 19, 1740, in a Bavarian village, and through the
special recommendation of Joseph Haydn was received on
June 1, 1761, into the orchestra of Count Esterhazy. In 1769
he left and joined the orchestra of the Italian opera in
Vienna. After three years of active work there he was
appointed to the Imperial band, and made Court and
Chamber musician; his death took place on January 25,
1820. Weigl composed, but if for his own instrument is
unknown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anton Filtz</span>, a member of the Electoral Chapel at
Mannheim, was a gifted cellist and composer. He died in
1768 in early manhood, before his talent had fully developed.
He left in MS. several duets and solos, as well as Concertos
for the Violoncello.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joh. Georg Schetky</span>, born 1740, at Darmstadt, deserves
special mention as a pupil of Filtz, whose instruction he
enjoyed for one month, after his father, who was Secretary to
the Grand Duke of Darmstadt and tenor singer at the
Cathedral, had given him his first musical education. He
seems to have taken up cello playing by himself at first, but
his theoretical education was carried on by the Concertmaster
Enderle. In the year 1761 Schetky went for six
months with his father and two sisters to Hamburg. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
he had the opportunity of hearing great artists, which incited
him to zealous study on his instrument. On his return to
Darmstadt he found a post in the orchestra there. Now and
then he performed at concerts in the neighbouring towns.
After the death of his parents he finally quitted Darmstadt in
1768. He visited Hamburg and then London, where the patronage
of Joh. Christoph Bach was of service to him. Schetky
did not however remain long in the English capital, as he
received a proposal to go to Edinburgh, which he accepted.
He very soon, in consequence of his marriage with a rich widow,
retired into private life, being known to fame only through
his compositions. These, taking no account of an important
collection of various orchestral and chamber music works,
consist of numberless Violoncello Concertos, Duets for Violin
and Violoncello, Sonatas for Violoncello and Bass, and “Twelve
Duets for two Violoncellos, with some Observations and Rules
for playing that Instrument” (Op. 7). In these duets, as the
title says: “Schetky had a scholastic aim in view.” Yet they
can scarcely be called a violoncello school.</p>

<p>One of the last of Schetky’s published works is his Op. 13,
which contains six Sonatas for Violoncello with unfigured bass.
The compositions therein contained give a distinct idea of his
fluent though superficially mechanical manner of writing. It
can readily be discerned that Schetky had for the time in
which he lived a remarkable technique in playing. He must
have been able with ease to play at sight the first violin
part in Quartets, a talent which proves at once his skill and
readiness. His power and agility in bowing as well as his
staccato playing in up and down strokes were famous.</p>

<p>According to Gerber’s account, Schetky died in Edinburgh
in 1773. In Forster’s “History of the Violin” it is said, on
the contrary, that his death took place only in 1824.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>As a “clever and solid concert player and composer for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
instrument,” <span class="smcap">Markus Heinrich Graul</span>, who was born in the
first half of the last century, is mentioned by Gerber. In the
year 1766 he belonged to the Royal orchestra at Berlin. He
also composed pieces for the cello, but did not publish them.</p>

<p>His pupil, <span class="smcap">Joh. Heinrich Viktor Rose</span>, born on December 7,
1743, at Quedlinburg, was early instructed to play on various
instruments by his father, who was town musician in the
above-named place. The Princess Amalie, who then filled the
office of Abbess in the Quedlinburg Convent, became interested
in him, and took him with her to Berlin in 1756, where he
studied cello playing for some years under Graul and Mara.
In 1763 he entered the service of the Prince of Anhalt-Bernberg.
Four years later he relinquished that in order to
travel, and accepted a place in the band of the Duke of
Dessau. He did not long remain there, for in the year 1772
he accepted an offer to be organist at the place of his birth.
According to Gerber’s account he possessed not only an
extraordinary readiness on the violoncello, but also a most
expressive, graceful rendering. Of his compositions, there
were three solos with bass accompaniment published as Op. 1.</p>

<p>His best pupil was <span class="smcap">Friedrich Schrödel</span>, born on February 4,
1754, in Baruth; died January 10, 1800, at Ballenstedt.
Gerber calls him one of the greatest masters on the violoncello
of that period, and adds that many were of opinion that
he surpassed the famous Mara in precision and delicacy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Jäger</span> must be noticed with special distinction as
belonging to the German cellists of the last century. Schubart,
who must have known him personally, says in his eccentric
manner: “Jäger is quite original; his bowing new, unconstrained,
and impetuously fiery. All masters apply the thumb
to the D string, and so bring out the high passages; but
Jäger departs entirely from this method&mdash;a proof that his
genius has more than one way of attaining his aim. He goes
with lightning dexterity up to the D and A strings in the
highest parts and brings out the most delicate phrases with
the greatest tenderness and sweetness.... Jäger is also
a great reader, <i>prima vista</i>&mdash;that is, he can play from the
music at sight the most difficult pieces with wonderful art.”</p>

<p>In regard to the Jäger Violoncello compositions, which
altogether remained unpublished, Schubart remarks: “He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
follows no rules in composition, but is guided solely by his
ear. His Concertos and Sonatas consist chiefly of original
themes, which are grand, noble, adapted to the instrument,
and full of difficulties. Jäger caused his pieces to be revised
by good musicians, whereby they were put into correct form.
At the same time it must be confessed that the superfluous
boughs, the offspring often of an unbridled fancy, have not
all been pruned off.”</p>

<p>As Jäger’s compositions are not extant there is no possibility
of putting to the proof the justice of Schubart’s judgment.</p>

<p>We can only gather that Jäger was self-taught. He
appears to have been so even as a player. There is nowhere
any intimation that he had any regular instruction on the
violoncello. Gerber makes only the remark that Jäger became,
under the influence of the Kapellmeister at Würtemburg,
“the great man” whom the world admired.</p>

<p>As Fétis informs us, Jäger was born on August 17, 1748, in
the little town of Schlitz.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> He was originally oboe player in
the service of Holland. He cultivated at first as his favourite
instrument the French horn. After he had been actively
engaged at the Court of Stuttgard, the post of chamber
virtuoso in the Anspach Bayreuth orchestra fell to his lot. The
position left him a great deal of spare time, so that he was
able to practise diligently the violoncello, and also to
undertake concert tours, which led him to London in 1781.</p>

<p>Jäger had two sons who were educated as violoncellists
under his direction. The elder, <span class="smcap">Johann Zacharias Leonhard</span>,
born 1777, at Anspach, showed an early development and
was able, even at nine years of age, to execute solos with
rapidity, certainty, and accuracy. In 1787 he played at the
Prussian Court, and on that occasion so greatly excited the
admiration of the Queen that she wished to acquire him
for the Royal band in Berlin, to which, however, the father
of the boy would not yield on account of his youth. The
Queen, therefore, proved her interest in him by granting him
a life-long pension of 100 thalers. On his return home the
Margrave of Anspach appointed him his chamber musician.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
He did not, however, remain long in this position, and went
with his father to Breslaw. There Jäger’s younger son was
born, whose christian name was Ernst. He possessed even
more talent than his brother, for it was not long before he
overtook him in cello playing, to which the instructions he
received from Bernhard Romberg greatly contributed. Until
the year 1825 he lived at Breslaw, after having travelled
through a great part of Germany and Hungary. Then he
responded to a summons from the Bavarian Court to go as
solo cellist to Munich.</p>

<p>Besides his two sons, Johann Jäger educated also <span class="smcap">Alexander
Uber</span>, born at Breslaw, 1783, as a capable violoncellist. His
father, by profession a solicitor, was an enthusiastic lover of
music, occupied his leisure hours with the composition of
chamber music, and instituted weekly two concerts in his
house. At one of them symphonies were produced, at the
other quartets and quintets. At the beginning of our century,
Carl Maria v. Weber, who began his career at the Breslaw
Theatre, took part in these musical entertainments, as did also
the Director of music in the University at Berne and the piano
player Klingohr. The intercourse with these men was not
of less importance for the musical development of young
Uber than his musical life in his father’s house. At first he
enjoyed the violin instruction of Jannizeck, while Schnabel
conducted his theoretical studies. But he very soon took up
the violoncello, for which Jäger was his teacher. In the year
1804 he undertook his first tour, but returned soon to
Breslaw. In the course of time Uber filled many positions as
Kapellmeister, until about 1820 he settled at Basle, where he
was married. In 1823 he undertook the post of Conductor
with the Count of Schönaich and Prince von Karolath,
but, in the following year, death carried him off. Of his
compositions for the violoncello, Uber published a Concerto
(Op. 12), Variations with Quartet accompaniment (Op. 14),
Six Caprices (Op. 10), and Sixteen Variations upon a
German air.</p>

<p>During the second half of the last century the art of violoncello
playing had already very extensively spread throughout
Germany and had many more noteworthy representatives
than in Italy and France. In the latter country the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
higher pursuit of music was confined chiefly to Paris, and
in Italy, as we have already remarked in a previous
paragraph, the opera was most decidedly in the foreground,
while there was no great demand for instrumental music.
On the contrary, Germany called out more instrumental
vigour in order to satisfy the need of good musicians for the
numberless Courts. According to Gottlieb Friedrich Krebel’s
European genealogical handbook of the year 1770, there were,
including the Romaic-German Emperor and the King of
Prussia, over two hundred secular and spiritual princes and
sovereign counts, the greater number of whom supported
Kapelle (bands) or at least chamber music. These persons
considered it of utmost importance to have about them not
only good violin and wind instrument players, but also
capable violoncellists, and consequently more talented young
men devoted themselves in Germany to instrumental music,
and especially to violoncello playing, than elsewhere.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the introduction of the Violoncello
from Italy to Germany was by way of Vienna. At
least, up to the present time, there are no proofs that
the appreciation of this instrument and its reception
into the orchestra had taken place sooner in other German
places than in the Austrian capital. There was an eager
demand for music from the reign of Maximilian I., to
which the musical inclinations of the Imperial family
contributed. Maximilian II., Ferdinand III., Leopold I.,
Charles VI., Francis I., and Joseph II., each in his own way,
presented to the inhabitants of Vienna a good example as
regarded the encouragement of music. Already several decades
before the birth of the last-mentioned prince, who himself
played the violoncello, this instrument had been naturalised
in Vienna as an orchestral instrument. Under his reign,
after the advent of Franciscello, whose performances gave an
impulse to emulation, Vienna was already in possession of
some remarkable solo cellists. To them belong the two
<span class="smcap">Schindlökers</span> and <span class="smcap">Joseph Weigl</span>, who have already been
mentioned, as well as <span class="smcap">Johann Hoffmann</span>, member of the
Court band, <span class="smcap">Marteau</span>, <span class="smcap">Hauer</span>, and <span class="smcap">Küffel</span>;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
later followed the cellists <span class="smcap">Cajetan</span>, <span class="smcap">Gottlieb</span>, <span class="smcap">Scheidl</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Hauschka</span>.</p>

<p>Nothing is known concerning Scheidl. We have more
information regarding <span class="smcap">Vincenz Hauschka</span>, who was born on
January 21, 1766, at Mies, in Bohemia, and died in Vienna,
1840. He received his first musical education as choirboy
in the Prague Cathedral. After six years’ study he devoted
himself to violoncello playing, in which the Bohemian, Christ,
instructed him for a short time. He eventually studied
independently. At sixteen he had made such progress that
he found a place in the Kapelle of Count Thun. Two
years later he was released from this engagement by the
death of his benefactor. Hauschka then undertook a tour
in Germany. In 1792 he appeared in Vienna, where he
gained everywhere applause by his performances. Later, a
situation was offered to him in the Imperial State service.
From that time he made no professional use of his art.
But he did not quite abandon it, as he took part in the
foundation of the “Society of the Friends of Music,” or
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</span>,” as well as the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concert
Spirituel</span>,” and was occupied also in both these musical
institutions which were of such importance to musical life
in Vienna.</p>

<p>The Dresden Hofkapelle possessed, in the second half of
the last century, two noteworthy cellists, <span class="smcap">Heinrich Megelin</span>
and <span class="smcap">Calmus</span>. The first, according to Gerber’s testimony, was
counted amongst the cleverest players of his instrument.
Calmus belonged, in 1797, to the orchestra of the Altona
“National Orchestra,” and was then a highly reputed
member of the Hofkapelle at Dresden, where he died January,
1809.</p>

<p>In Berlin the violoncello first came to be appreciated at
its due value through Frederick William II. It is true
it had been already well represented under Frederick the
Great, in the Court band, by <span class="smcap">Graul</span><a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and the two cellists
<span class="smcap">Mara</span> (father and son), to be mentioned elsewhere; but
that great monarch, whose favourite instrument was the
flute, does not appear to have thought much of the violon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>cello,
which he feigned to allude to as the “nasal instrument,”
an expression which might have been bestowed
formerly on the gamba.</p>

<p>His nephew, Frederick William II., liked the violoncello,
and well understood how to handle it. He appears to have
played the gamba in his younger days, for it is reported that
the gambist Hesse<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> first taught him, though this instruction
might also have referred to the violoncello, which
many gambists took up at the same time. Later on
the cellist <span class="smcap">Graziani</span> was master to the Prussian heir
to the throne. But when <span class="smcap">Duport the elder</span> came to
Berlin, in 1773, <span class="smcap">Graziani</span> was dismissed in favour of
him. The future king, Frederick William II., must have
played with taste and readiness. It is well known that
Beethoven dedicated to him his two Cello Sonatas (Op. 5).</p>

<p>Amongst the cellists who belonged to the Berlin Chapel
towards the end of the last century must be mentioned&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann George Fleischmann</span>, a skilful player, who was
at first in the service of the Duke of Courland, but afterwards
went to Berlin. In 1792 he followed the king, on his
expedition against the French, as his accompanist.</p>

<p>A second cellist, who worked at the same time in the Berlin
Kapelle, was <span class="smcap">S. L. Friedel</span>.</p>

<p>As a pupil of Duport the younger, <span class="smcap">Heinrich Grosse</span>, born at
Berlin, is distinguished. In 1798 he joined the Royal band.</p>

<p>The elder Duport<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> educated the cellist <span class="smcap">O. F. G. Hansmann</span>,
who was born at Potsdam on May 30, 1769, and was engaged
at fifteen years of age in the Berlin Kapelle. In 1790 he
undertook the post of Choir-director at the opera. He appears
to have quite given up his work as Kapellmeister when, in
1809, the place of Organist at the Church of St. Peter, at
Berlin, was given to him. He continued in the service of the
church until the year 1833, when he was appointed Royal
Accountant. Three years later, on May 4, 1836, death called
him away.</p>

<p>Finally, the Berlin Kapelle possessed, in <span class="smcap">Herbig</span>, a pupil
of the younger Mara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Court of Mecklenberg, in 1785, <span class="smcap">Franz Xaver Huber</span>,
born in the little Bavarian town of Öttingen, was working as
a much esteemed violoncellist.</p>

<p>In the Brunswick Kapelle was <span class="smcap">A. W. F. Matern</span>, after the
middle of the last century a player of some repute, who
brought up his two sons as cellists.</p>

<p>Hanover was represented by the brothers <span class="smcap">Friedrich Ernst</span>
and <span class="smcap">Philipp Friedrich Beneke</span>. Both belonged to the
Elector’s Court and Chamber Music Society.</p>

<p>The Hofkapelle at Dessau possessed, in <span class="smcap">Joh. Christoph
Bischoff</span>, born in 1748 at Erfurt, a very fair violoncellist.</p>

<p>As one of the most creditable cellists of the second half of
the last century, <span class="smcap">Joh. Conrad Schlick</span> must be mentioned. He
is said to have been born at Münster in 1759, and died at
Gotha in 1825, where he was established for more than forty
years with the title of Concertmaster of the Ducal band,
after he had, about 1776, belonged to the Episcopal Chapel at
Münster. In the year 1785 he married the very celebrated violin
virtuoso, Regina Strinasacchi, with whom he was engaged, in
the winter of 1799-1800, as solo player at the Leipsic Gewandhaus.</p>

<p>Schlick had a gifted pupil in <span class="smcap">J. G. Hemmerlein</span>, born at
Bamberg, who held the post of Concertmaster to the Elector
Bishop of Fulda at the end of last century.</p>

<p>At the same time with Schlick, <span class="smcap">Johann David Scheidler</span>,
born in 1748, died on October 20, 1802, was employed as a
much-liked violoncellist in the Gotha Kapelle.</p>

<p>The Ducal band of Meiningen also possessed a good violoncellist.
It was <span class="smcap">J. J. Kriegck</span>, originally violinist and member
of the Flemish Opera at Amsterdam. During his residence
in Paris he took up the violoncello, and received there
instruction from the younger Duport. After he had studied for
awhile under this artist he was engaged by Prince Laval
Montmorency, in whose service he remained four years, when
he was summoned to Meiningen. There he worked and was
still living in the year 1810. Kriegck was born on June 25,
1750, at Bibra, in the neighbourhood of Eckertsberga, in the
district of Merseburg. His cello compositions, consisting of
three Concertos and some Sonatas with bass, are among the
best of that period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The violoncellist <span class="smcap">Hizelberger</span> was, in 1786, in the service
of the Bishop of Würzburg as chamber musician.</p>

<p>At the Court of Wallenstein, about 1790, <span class="smcap">Paul Winneberger</span>
was engaged as Director of the Royal Hunt and Table Music.
In the year 1800 he exchanged this post for that of cellist and
composer to the French Theatre at Hamburg.</p>

<p>In the Thurn-and-Taxis Kapelle at Regensburg were two
cellists, <span class="smcap">Gretsch</span> and <span class="smcap">Karauschek</span>. The first was there
until his death, which occurred in 1784. Karauschek, on the
contrary, who was famous as an excellent cellist, only
belonged to it from 1750-1760. Religious fanaticism
caused him later to go into a Carmelite cloister. He died in
1789.</p>

<p>To the Munich Court music, in the second half of the
last century, belonged <span class="smcap">Virgili</span>.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> He is remarkable as having
given his first instruction to the violoncellist <span class="smcap">Moralt</span>. This
last artist, who was born in the Bavarian capital in 1780,
and died in 1829, finished his training under the violoncellist
<span class="smcap">Anton Schwarz</span>, of Mannheim, and, having completed his
studies, went into the Hofkapelle of his native city.</p>

<p>Another pupil of Anton Schwarz whose name is well known
was <span class="smcap">Max Bohrer</span>, born at Munich in 1785. He made such
progress, that already as a boy of fourteen years of age he
entered the Hofkapelle there. Soon after he undertook a
concert tour with his brother Anton, who was an able violinist,
and this led him to Vienna. There he heard Bernhard
Romberg, who henceforth became his model. Towards 1830,
after he had for a time been a member of the Royal band
at Berlin, he went to Paris, where his fine tone and
his ease in surmounting the most difficult passages excited
admiration. Then he travelled through Germany, in 1832
was appointed first cellist to the King of Wurtemburg with
the title of Concertmeister, went in 1838 (for the second
time) to St. Petersburg, and then proceeded to Italy. The
years 1842-1843 he spent in America giving concerts. He
took his last journey, which led him to the countries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Northern Europe, in 1847, but he was not able to obtain the
same amount of approbation, for he had lost a great deal of
his power of execution. He died in 1867. He edited three
Concertos, several “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Airs Variés</span>,” a “Fantasia” on a Russian
Volkslied, a Rondoletto with a quartet accompaniment, and
some Duets with violin.</p>

<p>Contemporary with the above-named Moralt in the Bavarian
Court Kapelle, “<span class="smcap">Peter the Great</span>,” so-called, according to
Gerber, “on account of his talent,” born at Zweibrücken,
in 1778, was actively engaged, and in 1792 was promoted
to be member of the Bavarian Hofkapelle.</p>

<p>For Stuttgard the violoncellists Zumpsteeg and Kaufmann
deserve consideration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joh. Rudolph Zumpsteeg</span> was the more important. He
was born on January 10, 1760, at Sachsenflur, in the Odenwald,
and died on January 27, 1802, at Stuttgard. The royal
Kapellmeister Poli (at Wurtemburg) was his teacher. Under
his direction Zumpsteeg became not only an excellent performer,
but also a creditable composer of music. He received
a learned education at the Karlschule, where he entered into
friendly relations with Schiller, and set to music many of
his poems. He made himself particularly known through
ballad compositions, which were first attempted by him.</p>

<p>After he had quitted the Karlschule, Zumpsteeg devoted
himself entirely and actively to art. Up to the year 1792 he
was simply member of the Stuttgard Court band, of which
he became the head after the decease of his master, Poli.
Zumpsteeg played the violoncello with “deep feeling, rare
precision, and decisive power,” as Gerber remarks. He wrote
for it a Concerto, Sonatas, a Duet, and a Trio.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Kaufmann</span>, born in 1760, was likewise a pupil at the
Karlschule, whence also came&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernst Häusler</span>, born in 1761, in Stuttgard. He led a
somewhat variable life. In the year 1788 he went on an
artistic tour, during which he played especially in Vienna and
Berlin. Soon after he took an engagement in the band of
the Prince of Donaueschingen. But in 1791 he relinquished
this position in order to obey a summons to Zurich. Thence,
six years later, he returned to his native town, and in 1801
went to Augsburg, and, in 1802, to Vienna, to hold concerts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Finally he assumed the office of choir director at the Evangelical
Church at Augsburg, in which place he died on
February 28, 1837.</p>

<p>The Electoral Kapelle at Mannheim possessed in <span class="smcap">Carl
Lochner</span>, born about 1760, died 1795, as well as in <span class="smcap">Peter
Ritter</span>, remarkable cellists. Ritter, born at Mannheim in
1760, must have had higher claims to distinction on account
of his musical education than Lochner, for he was promoted to
the direction of the opera at the theatre of his birthplace.
With the exception of a journey to Berlin, undertaken in the
year 1785, where he played before the Court, he seems to have
pursued uninterruptedly his official duties.</p>

<p>To the Mannheim orchestra belonged the violoncellists,
<span class="smcap">Johann Fürst</span>, <span class="smcap">Ludwig Simon</span>, and <span class="smcap">Anton Schwarz</span>, already
mentioned.</p>

<p>As an offspring of Mannheim, <span class="smcap">Franz Danzi</span> must also be
mentioned, the son of the first violoncellist in the orchestra
there, Innocenz Danzi. His father gave him instruction on the
cello, and Abt Vogler in composition. He soon made such
rapid progress in playing that already, in 1778, he was received
into the Electoral Kapelle, which, as is known, was transferred
to Munich about this time in consequence of the union of
Bavaria with the Palatinate. He immediately began his work
as a composer for the opera. Meantime, in the year 1790, he
was united in matrimony to the exquisite singer, Margaretha
Marchand, daughter of the Opera Director in Munich. The
following year the young couple went to Leipsic and Prague,
where Danzi conducted the opera of Guardassoni’s Italian
Opera Company, while his wife took part as a singer. In 1794-1795
he travelled with his wife in Italy, and in 1797 they both
returned to Munich on account of the failing condition of the
latter’s health. Danzi was immediately appointed Vice-Kapellmeister,
and displayed most praiseworthy activity. He
was, however, so overcome by the death, in 1799, of the
partner of his life, that for many years he seemed unable to
perform the duties of his vocation, and as it was repugnant to
his feelings to take up work again in the place where his
family happiness had been wrecked, he obeyed a summons to
Stuttgard as Court Kapellmeister. He there remained a
year, at the end of which he assumed the direction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
opera at Carlsruhe. Danzi was born May 15, 1763, and died
April 13, 1826.</p>

<p>In the chapel at Mainz, in the year 1783 to 1784, there
were the clever cellist and lutist, <span class="smcap">Joh. Christian Gottlieb
Schindler</span>, the brothers <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> and <span class="smcap">Andreas Schwachhofer</span>,
and at the Court of Treves was also at that time <span class="smcap">Carl Caspar
Eder</span>, born 1751 in Bavaria, who made himself known as a
cello player in several tours.</p>

<p>To the Electoral Kapelle at Bonn belonged <span class="smcap">Joseph Reicha</span>
and <span class="smcap">Maximilian Willman</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reicha</span>, uncle of the gifted composer, Anton Reicha, was
born at Prague in 1746; found at first a position with Count
Wallenstein, and a few years later received the appointment
of Concert leader at Bonn. He was working there with
some reputation until his death in 1795.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Willman</span>, born in 1768, at Forchtenberg, a village between
Würzburg and Mergentheim, was member of the Bonn Hofkapelle
in the last decade of the past century, after he had
been resident for a few years in Vienna. Later on he
returned to Vienna and found a post there as solo player at
the theatre. Willman, who died in 1812, had two daughters,
the elder of whom was a pupil of Mozart for the pianoforte,
and the younger an excellent singer. Louis von Beethoven
solicited the hand of the latter, but in vain.</p>

<p>Besides Reicha and Willman, the celebrated violoncellist,
<span class="smcap">Bernhard Romberg</span>, belonged to the Kapelle at Bonn from
1790-1793. With regard to this artist the necessary information
will be given in the next section on Germany, for the
distinctive influence of his work belongs to the nineteenth
century. To the above-mentioned German violoncellists
are to be added Immler, Schönebeck, Rauppe, Bauersachs,
Alexander, and Arnold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Immler</span>, born in 1750, at Weitramsdorf, near Coburg, found
a sphere for work in Göttingen. His playing was distinguished
especially for its fine tone and agreeable manner of rendering.
He was also a good violinist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl Siegmund Schönebeck</span>, born on October 26, 1758, at
Lübben, in Lower Lusatia, was originally destined for the
surgical profession, but felt himself so irresistibly drawn
towards music that all attempts to hold him back from it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
failed through his opposition. In the fourteenth year of his
age he was made town musician in his native place. During
his fifteenth year he devoted himself, mostly alone, to the
learning of various instruments. Then he went as assistant
to the town band of the Silesian town of Grüneberg. There
he had the opportunity of hearing a travelling violoncellist,
whose performances so inspired him that he forthwith resolved
to devote himself to cello playing, with which until then he
had never occupied himself. He was his own master. After
two years of energetic work, Schönebeck went as cellist into
the private band of a Count Dohna, though he only remained
in it until 1780, preferring to undertake a post which was
offered to him as town musician at Sorau. A journey to
Berlin procured him the possibility of hearing the violoncello
virtuoso Duport, at Potsdam, which incited him to renewed
study. Soon after he made, at Dresden, the acquaintance of
the French cellist Tricklir,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> whose playing gave him fresh
impulse. From that time Schönebeck led a restless, wandering
life, which prevented his attaining to the concentration of
his powers. At short intervals he filled, one after the other,
positions at the Court of the Duke of Courland, at Sagan;
with Count Truchsez, at Waldenberg; and still further at
Königsberg. At length, wearied with a musical life, he
returned home and devoted himself to husbandry, but did not
long persevere with this, and resumed again his artistic career.
In the year 1800 he performed at Leipsic, where his pleasing
cello compositions, and his playing “with a fine intonation,
and rare finish,” met with applause, as Gerber remarks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joh. Georg Rauppe</span>, born in July, 1762, at Stettin, devoted
himself in early youth to cello playing, and under the elder
Duport attained to the rank of a master. His studies ended,
he travelled through North Germany as well as Denmark and
Sweden. In the year 1786 he betook himself to Amsterdam,
and there fulfilled the duties of first cellist in the German
Opera as well as at concerts. While in that position he died
on June 15, 1814. His playing was famed for the beauty and
power of his tone, as well as for readiness and purity of
rendering.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Christian Friedrich Bauersachs</span>, born on June 4, 1767, at
Pegnitz, in the principality of Anspach, was not only
unusually clever on the violoncello, but also played the basset-horn
with great skill. He travelled through Hungary and
Italy, and then also in Germany, giving concerts with good
success. Yet he did not succeed in gaining a permanent post.
He therefore gave up music as a means of livelihood, and
devoted himself to a miner’s career. On December 14, 1845,
he died at Sömmerda.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Alexander</span>, who, in 1800, lived at Duisburg, and
worked there, is worthy of mention on account of two books of
Studies, which however are long since obsolete. They consist
of a violoncello school, published in 1801, and of an “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Air
avec xxxvi Variations progressives pour le Violoncelle avec le
doigté en différentes clefs, accomp. d’un violon et d’une
basse</span>” (1802).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Gottfried Arnold</span>, born on February 1, 1773, in
the Würtemburg town of Niedernhall, died July 26, 1806, at
Frankfort-on-the-Main, was the son of a school teacher. He
early applied himself to music, and chiefly to the violoncello,
so that at eight years of age he attracted notice by his
performances. In 1785 his father placed him under the
tuition of Lüngelsauer, the town musician, with whom he
studied for five years. At the expiration of that time Arnold
found employment with his uncle, who was Court and town
musician at Wertheim. During this period he pursued, alone,
with great zeal, his cello studies, but at the same time did
not neglect theoretical study. After some fruitless attempts
to make himself known as a soloist beyond his native place,
he visited Regensburg, where just then the violoncellist Max
Willman, mentioned above, was residing. He gave Arnold,
during some few months, instructions on the cello, the first
which he had received on this instrument. In the year 1796
he had the opportunity, in Hamburg, of hearing Bernhard
Romberg and learning from him. Very soon after Arnold
was established in the theatre orchestra at Frankfort. At
the same time he gave private lessons. He was esteemed by
his contemporaries as a great violoncello virtuoso, whose
playing, on account of its “enchanting tone,” was excellent,
not only in <i>Allegro</i>, but also in <i>Adagio</i> passages. Amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the German violoncellists of the last century an amateur
deserves mention, who so distinguished himself, that he may
properly be counted among the artists of his instrument. It
was the <span class="smcap">Prince Christian von Wittgenstein-Berleberg</span>. He
was born on December 12, 1753, and in his youth occupied
himself eagerly with singing and clavier playing. In more
advanced years he learnt the violoncello and succeeded so well
that he was heard with the greatest applause publicly at a
concert in Wetzlar. He maintained towards the end of his
life a private band. This patron of art died October 4,
1800.</p>

<p>These distinguished men up to this period, with few
exceptions, endeavoured, besides their practical work, to create
by their compositions a literature for their instrument.
They wrote concertos, sonatas, and works with variations, in
considerable numbers.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> These productions were substantially
increased by other musicians who were not cello players.</p>

<p>Before all, the most prominent are <span class="smcap">Phil. Emanuel Bach</span>
and <span class="smcap">Joseph Haydn</span>.</p>

<p>The former composed a Violoncello Concerto, the latter
several pieces of the same kind. What a lively interest
Haydn, especially, took in the violoncello is proved by the fact
that he used it as an obbligato in two of his Symphonies. The
first of them (B flat major) appears with the title, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Symphonie
Concertante à Violon, Violoncell, Flutte, Hautbois et Basson
obligés</span>,” as Op. 81; the other, called “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Midi</span>,” was written
in 1761.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Therein the violoncello is employed as a solo
instrument, chiefly in the <i>Adagio</i>, the close of which ends
with an elaborate cadenza for violin and violoncello. The
cello part in the above-mentioned “Sinfonie Concertante”
contains striking difficulties, especially where it is employed
in the higher tones.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst other composers of that period who composed
Concertos for the violoncello, we will only mention <span class="smcap">Paul
Wranitzky</span>, <span class="smcap">Ignaz Pleyel</span>, <span class="smcap">Franz Anton Hofmeister</span>, <span class="smcap">Franz
Christian Neubauer</span>, <span class="smcap">Leopold Hoffmann</span>, and <span class="smcap">Johann Ludwig
Willing</span>. There were also amateurs who attempted compositions
of this kind, such as <span class="smcap">Ernst Ludwig Gerber</span>, the author
of “The Historical-Biographical Dictionary of Musicians,”
and <span class="smcap">Christian Ferd. Daniel Schubart</span>, who, though he had a
musical education, was however really by vocation an author.
Further Joh. Geog. Albrechtsberger, Joseph Eybler, F. A.
Hoffmeister, C. G. Neubauer, Ignaz Pleyel produced Duets
for two violoncellos, violin and cello, or for viola and
violoncello. There is also in existence a Cello Sonata with unfigured
Bass by the contrabassist Christian Spurni (Spourni),
who, born in Mannheim, was, during the years 1763-1770,
member of the orchestra of the Italian Opera in Paris, and
then of Her Majesty’s in London.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The greater number of these compositions, whether emanating
from violoncello players or not, are interesting only in
so far as from them may be gathered what position German
violoncello playing held in the second half of the last century.
We have now only to state that the technique at the end of
the period mentioned had made great progress, and that
Germany, as compared with Italy, even taking into consideration
certain cello pieces by Boccherini, was not behindhand.
A universally current method for the manipulation of the
fingerboard and also for bowing had indeed not yet been
attained in either of the two countries. The testing in every
way of the executive capabilities of the violoncello naturally
followed, as well as discovering the various combinations for
playing double stops, the formation of passages and ornaments,
and the endeavour to develop and present them in
a manner suitable to the nature of the instrument. This
tedious work must on the outset have necessarily led to
productions in which the question of imagination would not be
taken into consideration. In fact, it is with few exceptions
of very little value, and as further the figures and runs are
antiquated, the compositions in question can awaken no real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
sympathy. But these trial stages which cello composition
had to pass through were necessary in order to arrive at
a literature of artistic worth.</p>




<h3>III.&mdash;FRANCE.</h3>


<p>Amongst the first noteworthy French violoncellists the
brothers <span class="smcap">Abbé</span> must be mentioned. They were music masters
of the parish church of Agen under their own names of
Philipp Pierre and Pierre de Saint Sevin. As such, in conformity
with the regulation of that time, they had to wear the
“collet” of the Catholic priests over their dress, on account
of which they were called shortly Abbé, or l’Abbé. They
retained this name, with the addition of “l’Aîné” and
“Cadet,” after they had given up their posts in Agen and had
entered the Paris Opera Orchestra as cellists in 1727.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This
is all that is known about them.</p>

<p>There is more information extant concerning <span class="smcap">Berteau</span>.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
This artist, born at the beginning of the eighteenth century
at Valenciennes, was esteemed by his contemporaries as of
eminent talent&mdash;indeed, as a genius. In his youth he travelled
through Germany, and during this time he applied himself
with vigour to gamba playing, under the direction of a
Bohemian of the name of Kozecz, and acquired great
proficiency. However, after he became acquainted with the
superiority of the violoncello, and had heard a solo piece for
it by Franciscello,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> according to Fétis, he went over to that
instrument. His progress was so remarkable that he was
ever without a rival, and was looked upon as a wonder on his
return to Paris, for he also performed unusually well on the
flageolet, the playing of which had been little developed. In
the year 1739 he was heard for the first time at the “Concert
Spirituel”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> in a solo of his own composition, and aroused
great enthusiasm. The result was a frequent appearance at
these concerts. His chief strength lay in the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
an extraordinary richness of tone. He wrote for the violoncello
four Concertos as well as three Sonatas with bass
accompaniment. His death took place in 1756. Berteau was
looked upon as the founder of the French school of violoncello
playing. Fétis asserts as a proof of this that as pupils he
educated <span class="smcap">Cupis</span>, <span class="smcap">Janson</span>, <span class="smcap">Tillière</span>, and the elder of the
brothers <span class="smcap">Duport</span>, who were the propagators of his beautiful
tone as well as his melodious manner of rendering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jean Baptist Cupis</span>, born in 1741, in Paris, received his
first lessons from his father, and in his eleventh year became
Berteau’s pupil. Before he had passed the second decade of
his life he was already esteemed as one of the cleverest
cellists in France. He was soon received into the Opera
Orchestra in Paris, and, indeed, with the distinction that he
was associated with those members of it who had to accompany
the solo singers.</p>

<p>In the year 1771 he gave up his connection with the opera
in order to undertake some concert tours. He visited a great
part of Germany, remained some time in Hamburg, and then
went to Paris and Italy, where he married the songstress
Gasparini. In 1794 he was in Milan. From that time
nothing more is known about him. The requisite information
concerning his pupils, Jean Henri Levasseur and Bréval, will
be given farther on.</p>

<p>Cupis composed two Concertos and a couple of pieces with
variations, of which the second, for two violoncellos, appeared
only as a “Posthumous work” after his death. Besides these,
he wrote a violoncello school. It bears the title “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méthode
nouvelle et raisonnée pour apprendre à jour du violoncelle, où
l’on traite de son accord, de la manière de tenir cet
instrument avec aisance, de celle de tenir l’archet, de
la position de la main sur la touche, du tact, de l’étendue du
manche, de la manière de doigter dans tous les tons majeurs et
mineurs, etc. Paris, Boyer</span>.”</p>

<p>Berteau’s second pupil, <span class="smcap">Jean Baptiste Aimé Joseph Janson</span>,
was born at Valenciennes in 1742. At twenty-four he was
heard for the first time as solo-player at the “Concert
Spirituel.” In 1767 he went as accompanist to the heir-apparent
of Brunswick to Italy, and remained there till 1771.
He then returned for a few years to Paris, after which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
travelled in Germany. From Hamburg, where he remained
until 1783, he visited Denmark, Sweden, and Poland. He
everywhere reaped great applause for his performances, which
were distinguished for their broad and fine tone. In the year
1789 he again found himself in Paris. The value that was
set upon his playing there is proved by his being offered the
post of teacher of the violoncello at the Conservatoire, which
was founded in the year 1795. He died September 2, 1803.
Of his violoncello compositions, Fétis mentions three Concertos
(Op. 3), three Concertos (Op. 7), both with a bass; six Concertos
with orchestra (Op. 15), and six Sonatas with bass (Op. 4).</p>

<p>Janson had a younger brother, whose Christian names were
<span class="smcap">Louis Auguste Joseph</span>, whom he instructed as a skilful cellist,
after his father had prepared him for it. In 1789 he was given
a place in the Parisian Orchestra, which he held till 1815.
He died a few years later. He was born on July 8, 1749. He
only published six Sonatas for the violoncello with bass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Bonaventure Tillière</span>, of whom neither the day of
birth nor death is known, was about 1760 in the service of the
Prince de Conti, after he had finished his studies under
Berteau. He had the reputation of being a clever player.
His published works consist of six Sonatas for violoncello and
bass, nine Duets for two violoncellos, of which three appeared
as Op. 8, and also of a violoncello school, published in 1764:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méthode pour le Violoncelle, contenant les principes nécessaires
pour bien jouer de cet instrument</span>.” This work appeared
in several editions.</p>

<p>Berteau’s best pupil was <span class="smcap">Jean Pierre Duport</span>, called the
elder,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> whose father was a dancing master. He was born in
Paris, November 27, 1741. He was heard at twenty years of
age, with unanimous applause, in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concert Spirituel</span>.”
At the same time (1761) he was appointed one of the private
musicians of the Prince de Conti. He gave up the post in
1769 in order to travel. He first went to England, two years
later he visited Spain, and in 1773 he went to Berlin, where he
remained, as Frederick the Great engaged him for his
chamber musician as well as for the opera. He was at the
same time teacher to the future King Frederick William II.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
who named him in 1787 superintendent of chamber music.
From that time Duport no longer worked in the Opera,
but only played at Court. On December 31, 1818, he died
at Berlin. Duport published, in 1787,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> at Berlin, six Sonatas
for violoncello and bass, as well as three Duets for two
violoncellos, known as Op. 1.</p>

<p>Gerber, who had the opportunity of hearing this artist in
1793, in Berlin, gives an enthusiastic account of his playing.
He especially commended his strong, full tone, and his powerful
bowing. According to Fétis, however, his younger brother, <span class="smcap">Jean
Louis</span>, surpassed him, and he seems to have been remarkably
gifted. He had at first chosen the violin as his instrument,
but took up by preference the violoncello, when he saw the
artistic success of his brother, whose pupil he became. He
very soon acquired considerable reputation by his appearance
at the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concert Spirituel</span>” and at the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Société Olympique</span>,”
formerly known under the name of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concerts des Amateurs</span>”;
and also by his connection with the house of Baron Bagge,
so much frequented at that time by native and foreign
artists of note.</p>

<p>When Viotti came to Paris, either at the end of 1781 or the
beginning of 1782, and Duport heard him, he took his characteristic
style of playing as his model, and his performances
gained considerably thereby. He undertook his first concert
tour to London in company with the English cellist, Crosdill,
who was connected with him, and he there met with a most
animated reception. This journey kept him six months away
from Paris. But he did not remain then long at home. The
ominous events which, in 1789, preceded the Revolution caused
him, like a great many others, to fly from Paris. He betook himself
to his brother in Berlin, where he soon found employment
in the Royal orchestra, to which he was attached for seventeen
years. During this time he had many pupils, whose names
unfortunately are unknown. His pupils of French nationality&mdash;Rousseau,
Levasseur, and Platel&mdash;will be noticed
later.</p>

<p>The events of 1806, so unfortunate for Prussia, obliged
Duport to leave Berlin. He returned again to Paris. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
during his long absence he had been forgotten, and he had to
gain for himself another public.</p>

<p>A single public appearance in the year 1807, in which he
was supported by the assistance of the singer, Colbran,
Rossini’s future wife, was sufficient for this. He could not,
however, attain to any certain or decided position again by
reason of the entire change of circumstances little favourable
to Art in Paris. This obliged him to enter the service of
Charles IV. of Spain, who had been dispossessed by Bonaparte,
and who was then at Marseilles. But this connection came
to an end in 1812, when Charles IV. went to Rome, and
Duport consequently was obliged to return to Paris. He took
part in three concerts, and in spite of his advanced age of
sixty-five years, had so great a success that he was named
solo cellist to the Emperor and teacher at the Conservatoire.
He lost the latter post on the re-organization of the above-named
Institution in the year 1816. He remained,
however, in his position at Court, which meantime had been
changed from an imperial to a monarchical one. But only
three years after he succumbed to a liver attack, on September
7, 1819. He was born on October 4, 1749.</p>

<p>Louis Duport was the author of a tolerable number of cello
compositions. They consist of four books of Sonatas with bass
accompaniment, three Duets for two violoncellos, and eight
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Airs Variés</span>” with orchestra or quartet accompaniment.
Besides these he composed, in connection with Bochsa, nine
Nocturnes for harp and violoncello, a “Fantasie” for piano and
violoncello in conjunction with Rigel, and a Romance with
piano accompaniment. As his <i>chef d’œuvre</i> must be distinguished:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai sur le doigter du violoncelle et la conduite
de l’archet, dédie aux professeurs de violoncelle.</span>” This comprehensive
instruction book, for which the materials were collected
by degrees during a long period of years, was published by
Duport during his residences in Berlin and Potsdam. In the
preface he says: “I have treated with minute detail the
subject of double-stops, and this I have done for two reasons:
the first is that until now nothing concerning them has been
written,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and they are so important for a good player; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
second, because they have so often served me as an argument,
for without an established mode of fingering, double notes are
impossible. In the course of this work things will be met
with of which the performance is difficult, but nothing will be
presented which is really impracticable. I am not writing
a useless theory. I have put down no scales, no figures, no
passages, no exercises, without having repeatedly tried them
myself. I caused them to be repeatedly played by my brother,
who was formerly my master, and will ever remain so, as well
as by the best of my pupils in Berlin and Potsdam. I
am therefore thoroughly convinced that the work contains
nothing that may not with ease be clearly and distinctly
carried out, and what at first appears impracticable will be
practicable for those who will give themselves continuous
trouble, and make a point of practising a regular course of
fingering.”</p>

<p>It is evident that Duport devoted himself with the greatest
care to the working out of his book of instruction (which must
be accounted a violoncello school) in order to bring about
distinctness in the finger technique, not until then fully
settled. For that time it was a meritorious undertaking.
A new edition of it, brought out by the violoncellist, A.
Lindner, is a proof that the work, in spite of its age, is not
quite without value. It is only to be regretted that the
original text has not throughout been faithfully adhered
to, and that in parts it has been suppressed. The editor
should have reproduced the work in its original form,
and have enunciated his own dissenting opinions in
observations.</p>

<p>Of more value for our present purpose than Duport’s work
just mentioned are his Twenty-one “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Exercices</span>,” which contain
much that is worthy of consideration and of acquisition.
Duport left a son who, for a long time, belonged to the
orchestra at Lyons, but then opened a piano manufactory
in Paris. The splendid Stradivari cello, which he inherited
from his father, he disposed of to the violoncello virtuoso,
Franchomme, for 25,000 francs.</p>

<p>Amongst Duport’s pupils, <span class="smcap">Frederick Rousseau</span>, born
January 11, 1755, at Versailles, must be mentioned. He was
member of the Parisian Opera Orchestra in 1787. In 1812<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
he retired from his position and established a music school in
his native town. He was of special importance in the
musical life of Paris as having been one of the founders of
the Concert Institute of the “Rue de Cléry,” formerly so
popular. Amongst his compositions he published six “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duos
concertants</span>” (Op. 3 and 4) as well as a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Potpourri</span>” for two
violoncellos.</p>

<p>Taking up the chronological thread from Berteau, we have
next to mention the cellist <span class="smcap">Charles Henri Blainville</span>, who
was born in a village near Tours, in the year 1711, and died
in Paris, in 1769. The intimate circumstances relating to
his life are unknown. Only so far is certain, that he enjoyed
the protection of the Marquise de Villeroy, who received
musical instruction from him, and that apparently through
the influence of this lady he obtained the position of a
creditable “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maître de Musique</span>” in Paris. Blainville published
several theoretical works and a few compositions, amongst
them two Symphonies, but nothing for his own instrument.</p>

<p>The cellist <span class="smcap">Nochez</span>, born between 1720 and 1730, is known
as a pupil of Cervetto and Abaco.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In his early years he
travelled in Italy and was then member of the comic opera in
Paris, from which he went to the orchestra of the grand
Opéra in 1749. In 1763 he received the appointment of royal
chamber musician. He died in 1800 after a year spent in
retirement. Nochez is the author of an article on the
violoncello which appeared in print in de La Borde’s “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai
sur la musique ancienne et moderne</span>” (Paris, 1780).</p>

<p>Concerning the violoncellist <span class="smcap">Edouard</span>, only the following
notice is found in Gerber: “A violoncellist living in Paris,
in 1737, was an extraordinary artist on his instrument,
and was much commended by Telemann” (Ehrenpforte,
367).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Claude Domergue</span>, born at Beaucaire in 1734, seems to
have been remarkable among French violoncellists, although
he never left his home. That Duport, when he was travelling
in the South of France, stopped at Beaucaire solely in order
to make Domergue’s acquaintance is sufficient proof of his
unusual skill in execution. During the disturbances of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Revolution he unhappily ended his days, with thirty of his
fellow citizens, on the scaffold, in 1794.</p>

<p>To the Paris Opera orchestra belonged <span class="smcap">François Joseph
Giraud</span>, the violoncellist, from 1752-1767. Besides this he
was chamber musician. He wrote a volume of Sonatas for
his instrument. Further, he occupied himself with vocal
composition, and also wrote for the stage.</p>

<p>The next to be mentioned is <span class="smcap">Jean Tricklir</span>, already named,
of German extraction, born at Dijon in 1750, who passed only
his youth in France. Destined by his parents for the church,
he went to the seminary of his birthplace. In his leisure
hours he occupied himself with cello playing. His partiality
for it increased by degrees as he advanced in skill, and in his
fifteenth year he embraced the resolution of devoting himself
to the art. For this object Tricklir went to Mannheim, where
he remained several years and reached a master-pitch by
zealous study under the direction of experienced teachers.
After he had been several times to Italy, he was received in
March of the year 1783 as a member of the Court band at
Dresden, to which he belonged as a highly appreciated artist
until his death on November 29, 1813. His published compositions
consist of seven Concertos and six Sonatas for
violoncello. It must also be noticed that Tricklir thought
to have discovered by a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Microcosme Musical</span>” a sure
means of keeping stringed instruments continually in even,
pure tune. It was, however, an illusion, and this imaginary
invention disappeared as quickly as it had originated.</p>

<p>A remarkable scholar of Tricklir’s was <span class="smcap">Dominique Bideau</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Bidaux</span>, as he called himself in his violoncello school. He
belonged to the orchestra of the “Théâtre Italien” in Paris.
His compositions in relation to the violoncello are “Six duos
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour Violon et Violoncelle</span>” (Op. 1 and 2), Paris, 1796;
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trois grands divertissements concertants pour violon et
violoncelle</span>,” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un air ecossais varié avec quatuor</span>,” “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Deux
duos faciles pour deux violoncelles</span>,” and some other things of
the same kind. The title of his violoncello school runs thus:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande et Nouvelle Méthode raisonnée pour le Violoncelle,
composée par Dominique Bidaux. Paris, 1802.</span>”</p>

<p>A contemporary of Bidaux, <span class="smcap">Pierre François Olivier
Aubert</span>, born 1763 at Amiens, also brought out a violoncello<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
method.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> He received his first musical instruction in the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maîtrise</span>” of his native town, but he learned cello playing by
himself, without any other assistance. After his arrival in
Paris, he found a place in the orchestra of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Opéra
Comique</span>,” to which he belonged for twenty-five years. His
cello method was, as Fétis remarks, the first good instruction
book which followed after the insufficient preparatory
works by Cupis and Tillière.</p>

<p>Aubert wrote for his instrument twelve Duets in four parts,
as Op. 3, 5, 6, and 7; some Studies, besides three Sonatas,
Op. 8; and lastly, eight Sonatas.</p>

<p>A second violoncellist of the same name, who was commonly
called <span class="smcap">Auberti</span>, worked in the orchestra of the Paris Commédie
Italienne. He died in the year 1805. Of his compositions
six Solos for the violoncello (Op. 1) appeared, and six Duets for
two violoncellos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F. Cardon</span> was a member of the Paris Opera orchestra in the
middle of the last century. He educated his nephew, <span class="smcap">Pierre
Cardon</span>, born in 1751, who at the same time studied singing
under Richer. The latter seems to have been his chief
occupation, since he became a singer in the Royal Chapel in
1788, and gave singing lessons. He was, however, also
engaged as a teacher of cello playing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Esprit Aimon</span>, born at Lisle (Vaucluse), in 1754, is also distinguished
as a clever violoncellist. He conducted for a long
time the music of the Danish Minister, Count Rantzau; he then
settled down in Marseilles. In the year 1828 he died in Paris.</p>

<p>The cellist, <span class="smcap">Pierre François Levasseur</span>, born at Abbeville,
in 1753, was intended for the church, and received for that
end a liberal education. He decided, however, in the eighteenth
year of his life for art. A certain Belleval directed for
three months his practice on the violoncello. This instruction,
however, does not seem to have satisfied him, for he preferred
to be his own master. When he came to Paris, in 1782, he
received a few lessons from Duport the younger,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> whose tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and style he adopted. In 1789 he played at the “Concert
Spirituel” some of his master’s solo pieces, and later he
appeared at the concerts of the “Théâtre Feydeau.” From
1785-1815 he was a member of the Opera orchestra. Soon
after his retirement from this he died. The compositions
which he published were twelve Duets for two violoncellos
in two volumes.</p>

<p>There was another cellist, <span class="smcap">Levasseur</span>, about ten years
younger, who sprang from another family so-called, and whose
Christian name was <span class="smcap">Jean Henri</span>. He seems to have been
more remarkable than his namesake mentioned above. He
was born in 1765 in Paris, was a pupil of Cupis, and
belonged consequently to Berteau’s school. After he had
pursued his studies with the former artist, he profited
for some time by the instruction of the younger Duport. He
was then received into the Paris Opera orchestra, to which
he belonged as first violoncellist until 1823, the year of his
death. He was also for some time active as a teacher at the
Conservatoire. He likewise had a place at the Court Music
of Napoleon, and from 1814 in the Royal band. That he
was amongst the first in rank who belonged to the violoncello
school of the Conservatoire, under the direction of
Baillot, is a proof of the repute in which he was held in
Paris. Of his own compositions, he only left a set of
Sonatas with bass, two sets of Duets, and a volume of
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Exercices</span>.”</p>

<p>Levasseur’s most prominent pupils were <span class="smcap">Lamare</span> and
<span class="smcap">Norblin</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jaques Michel Hurel de Lamare</span>, born on May 1, 1772, in
Paris, died on March 27, 1823, in the town of Caen, where he
possessed some property, was the son of poor parents and got
his scientific as well as his artistic education together with
the Pages of the Court Music. In his fifteenth year he began,
under the direction of the younger Duport, violoncello playing,
for which he developed an extraordinary talent. Before he
had reached seventeen years of age, he left the Pages’
Institute and returned to his parents. In 1794 he found a
place in the orchestra of the Théâtre Feydeau. The then
famous concerts of this institution gave him the wished-for
opportunity of making himself known as a solo player. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
excellent performances procured for him very soon the
reputation of first French violoncellist of his time. The
Committee of the Paris Conservatoire hastened to secure
him as a teacher. But he desired to go out into the world,
and at the beginning of 1801 he went to Germany. At Berlin
he was brought into intimate relations with Prince Louis
Ferdinand, and played a great deal with him; as a mark
of distinction he presented him with a ring on condition that
he would exchange it with one that Lamare himself wore.
From Germany Lamare went to Russia. He lived there
alternately at St. Petersburg and Moscow until 1808. During
this period he was not only soloist at the Imperial Court, but
was also active in giving concerts. On his return to France
he took the route through Poland and Austria. In April,
1809, he returned to Paris and soon organised a concert in
the Odéon without, however, exciting in any way his audience,
which determined him not to play publicly again. He only
allowed himself to be heard in private circles, where great
admiration for his playing was conceded to him. He must
have been an excellent performer in ensemble and also in
quartet playing. In 1815 he married a lady of fortune.
From that time he only pursued his art for pleasure. On
March 27, 1823, he succumbed to an affection of the larynx.</p>

<p>Lamare wrote nothing for his instrument. He was
destitute of any gift of form. The compositions published in
Paris under his name, consisting of four violoncello Concertos,
Duets, and an “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Air varié</span>” for violoncello, originated probably
from the opera composer Auber, who was an intimate friend
of Lamare. Of the Concertos, the one in A minor is the
best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis Pierre Martin Norblin</span> was the son of the French
painter, Norblin de la Gourdaine, of some repute in his time,
who, in 1772, selected Warsaw as his permanent residence
and there married a Polish lady. The artist just now
mentioned, born on December 2, 1781, was the offspring of
this union. In 1798 he went to Paris for the sake of the
Conservatoire and was first Baudiot’s and then Levasseur’s
pupil. In the year XI., according to the reckoning of the
French Republic&mdash;that is, 1803&mdash;he received the first prize at a
competition of the directors of the above-named Institution for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
his performances in solo playing. Six years later, 1809, he
was appointed to the orchestra of the “Théâtre Italien,” and,
in 1811, solo violoncellist in the orchestra of the Grand
Opéra. In this position he remained until 1841. Besides
this, he gave instructions at the Conservatoire from January 1,
1826, as successor of his master, Levasseur; on June 5,
1846, he gave this up, in order to withdraw into private life.
He died on July 14, 1854, at Château Connautre, in the
Department of the Marne.</p>

<p>Norblin was highly estimated, not only as a soloist, but
also as a delicate, tasteful quartet player. For many years
he took the violoncello parts in the Baillot String Quartets.
He gained special distinction from the musical world of
Paris, for having assisted in the foundation of the Conservatoire
Concerts, called into existence by Habeneck, in
1828.</p>

<p>His son and pupil, <span class="smcap">Emile</span>, born April 2, 1821, was a skilful
violoncellist, who received the Conservatoire prize. He,
however, devoted himself more to teaching than solo playing.</p>

<p>Cupis’s pupil, <span class="smcap">Jean Baptiste Bréval</span>, already mentioned,
born, in 1756, in the Department of the Aisne, so quickly
developed his talent that he was able very early to appear at
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concert Spirituel</span>” with brilliant success. He was a
member of the Paris Opera orchestra from 1781 to 1806. In
1796 followed his nomination as teacher of violoncello playing
at the Conservatoire. From this he was released in 1802, as
the number of the pupils at the Institution was not large
enough to keep him employed. Towards the end of his life
Bréval retired to Chamouille, a village in the neighbourhood
of Laon. He shortly after died there, at the end of the year
1825.</p>

<p>Bréval published for the violoncello seven Concertos, five
sets of Duets, three Sonatas with bass, and twelve “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Airs
variés</span>.” Besides these he wrote two Concertantes, Quartets,
Trios, and an instruction book under the title “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méthode
raisonnée de Violoncelle</span>,” which appeared in Paris in 1804.
His cello pieces were formerly much in request, but have been
long obsolete. As a player Bréval had a finished style, but in
his rendering lacked force and energy.</p>

<p>Of similar kind is the verdict regarding the pupil of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
elder Janson, <span class="smcap">Charles Nicolas Baudiot</span>, who was born on
March 29, 1773, at Nancy, and died in Paris on September
26, 1849. Fétis, who had heard him, says that his rendering,
though of great neatness and purity of tone, was cold
and without spirit. It appears that he possessed an extraordinary
talent for teaching, for he was, in 1802, the
successor of his master at the Conservatoire, and worked
there until the year 1822 when he accepted a pension. He
had an official post in the Treasury as well as his artistic
occupation.</p>

<p>In 1807 he was unfortunate in exciting the ridicule of an
audience, at a concert given by the famous Catalani, in which
he took part. The occasion was of a very harmless nature.
In the said concert a Symphony of Haydn was played, and
Baudiot had a solo to perform immediately after. It was a
“Fantaisie” on the <i>Andante</i> of the German master’s Symphony
which had just been executed, and of the performance
of which the soloist had no suspicion, as he entered the hall
when his turn came. Scarcely had Baudiot begun Haydn’s
Theme when the public, who thought he wanted to have a
joke, burst out into hearty laughter. The artist, who was at
a loss to explain the demeanour of his audience, and ignorant
of the connection of affairs, became excited and played out of
tune, whereupon the laughter was repeated with renewed
vigour. Having lost his self-control, and being on the point of
fainting, he left the platform, supported by a fellow artist.
Baudiot wrote for the violoncello two Concertos and two
Concertinos, as well as a great number of other compositions,
consisting of Duets, Potpourris, Fantaisies, Nocturnes, Sonatas,
with bass accompaniment, and transcribed besides violin pieces
by Lafont and Beriot. He was also the author of a method for
his instrument, and under the direction of Baillot, and with
the co-operation of Levasseur, he took part also in the
production of a violoncello method for use in the Conservatoire.</p>

<p>Of Baudiot’s pupils, <span class="smcap">Scipion Rousselot</span>, born at the
beginning of our century, deserves notice. During his attendance
at the Conservatoire, he received also instruction in
composition from Reicha. At the completion of his studies
the first prize was allotted to him (1823). Rousselot went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
later on to England. Besides several chamber music compositions
and a Symphony, there appeared by him three
Sonatinas, some books of Variations, and a “Morceau de
Salon” for violoncello.</p>

<p>A fellow student of Baudiot’s, under Janson the elder, was
<span class="smcap">Pierre Louis Hus-Desforges</span>, grandson of the violin virtuoso,
Jarnowick. Hus-Desforges was born at Toulon in 1773,
where his mother, Jarnowick’s daughter, was performing as
an actress. At the age of eight his parents confided him to
the boys’ choir of the Cathedral at La Rochelle. As he had
occupied his leisure hours with trumpet blowing, he accepted
the duty of trumpeter (1792) to the 14th Regiment in order to
join in the campaigns of the Revolutionary Army. Four years
after he lost a finger of his right hand by a musket ball and
was consequently invalided. He now tried his fortune as
cellist, for during his sojourn at La Rochelle he had acquired
some facility on the violoncello. He succeeded in being
appointed to the theatre orchestra. In the course of six
months he relinquished this and chose Paris as his residence.
Here he was received into the Conservatoire and assigned to
the pupils of Janson. After his release from the Conservatoire,
Hus-Desforges led, like his grandfather Jarnowick, a perpetually
changing life. In the year 1800 he went as head of the
orchestra with a French opera troupe to St. Petersburg, in
1810 he returned and made some concert tours in France, in
1817 came back to Paris and undertook the functions of first
cellist at the Theatre “Porte Saint Martin,” in 1820 went to
Metz and founded there a music school, made fresh journeys,
and in 1828 was the head of the orchestra at the “Théâtre du
Gymnase,” but at the end of a year asked for his dismissal.
He did the same again when in 1831 he had succeeded in
obtaining the office of Director of the orchestra at the Theatre
of the Palais Royal. He spent the end of his chequered
career in the little town of Pont-le-Roi, near Blois, as teacher
at the music school there, where he died January 20, 1838.</p>

<p>Hus-Desforges was a clever, skilful violoncellist, but he did
not belong to the number of prominent, practised artists of
his time. His tone was weak and his performances lacked
force and brilliancy, as Fétis remarks. His violoncello compositions,
which were formerly somewhat liked, consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
four Concertos and nine Airs with variations, entitled “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soirées
Musicales</span>,” four Duets, and two Sonatas with bass. Besides
these he wrote a violoncello method.</p>

<p>Of far greater importance to the art of violoncello playing
was Duport the younger’s pupil, <span class="smcap">Nicolas Joseph Platel</span>, who
was born in the year 1777 at Versailles, and received his first
musical instruction in the Institution of royal pages. There
was then no attempt at violoncello playing, but about the
tenth year of the boy’s age the inclination for it was developed.
Louis Duport, who discerned a disposition favourable
to it, devoted himself with special zeal to his training. These
relations were broken off, when Duport, at the end of 1789,
left France in order to seek a position in Berlin. From that
period Platel was thrown for a long time upon his own resources.
In the year 1793 he was drawn into close relations with Lamare,
who sought in every way to forward him. In 1796 Platel
became a member of the orchestra of the “Théâtre Feydeau.”
He was deprived of his post on account of a love affair with
an actress of that institution, with whom he went to Lyons at
the end of 1797. When he returned to Paris in 1801, he appeared
several times at concerts with great success. He was then
reputed the best violoncellist in Paris, and the absence of
Duport and Lamare abroad stood him in good stead.</p>

<p>Platel might now have made his fortune in the French
capital. However, on account of the carelessness of his disposition
and his unpractical nature, he knew not how to turn
his opportunities to advantage. In 1805 he left Paris in
order to undertake a concert tour, but at Quimper, where
he made the acquaintance of a cello playing dilettante, he
remained quite two years. He then finally came to the
resolution of again beginning his wanderings. When he had
appeared in concerts at Brest and Nantes with great success,
he went North with the intention of visiting Holland and
thence Germany. This plan, however, was not carried out.
Platel settled himself down, on the way to the former place, at
Ghent, remained there giving lessons several years, and then
went to Antwerp. An opera troupe was there at the time
who engaged him as first violoncellist. About six years later
he undertook the same function in the theatre at Brussels.
This was the turning-point which decided Platel’s destiny. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Prince of Chimay engaged him for the Royal Music School of
the Belgian Court, which was opened in 1831. By accepting
this office, to which he devoted himself until his death on
August 25, 1835, he became the founder of the Belgium school
of violoncello playing, from which emanated, under his
direction, such artists as Batta, Demunck, and Servais.</p>

<p>Platel’s compositions consist of five Concertos, of which the
last is entitled “Le Quart d’heure,” also of three books of
Sonatas with bass accompaniment, and eight “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Airs Variés</span>”
of “Caprices ou Préludes,” and six Romances with piano
accompaniment. Besides these he wrote six Duets for violoncello
and violin, and three Trios for violin, viola, and
violoncello.</p>

<p>We must mention here three French cellists of the second
half of last century, whose master is not known&mdash;namely,
Chrétien, Haillot, and Raoul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gilles Louis Chrétien</span>, born in 1754 at Versailles, and
died in Paris, March 4, 1811, at the age of twenty-two found
a position as Royal band musician. He possessed great
readiness and a good tone, though he played without expression.
He lost his place by the Revolution, but was indemnified
in 1807 by being received into the Imperial orchestra.
He does not seem to have occupied himself with composition,
but as a writer on music, though without much success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Haillot</span> belonged to the orchestra of the “Comédie
Italienne,” and was also engaged in private teaching. By his
arrangements of operas in the form of duets he supplied the
wants of amateur cello players.</p>

<p>Finally, <span class="smcap">Jean Marie Raoul</span>, an enthusiastic friend of art&mdash;who
besides his official position as crown lawyer and, later, as
Justice at the Paris Cour de Cassation, cultivated zealously
the violoncello, on which he distinguished himself&mdash;must be
mentioned in this place as the author of a violoncello school.
It appeared under the title of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méthode de violoncelle,
contenant une nouvelle exposition des principes de cet
instrument</span>.” Raoul composed also some Sonatas and “Airs
variés” for his favourite instrument. His efforts, supported
by Vuillaume, the well-known Parisian violin maker, to
restore the gamba to practical use were in vain. Raoul was
born in Paris, in 1766, and died there in 1837.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>When we survey the progressive development of violoncello
playing from its commencement to the close of the eighteenth
century under all aspects, the following facts are presented to
us: violoncello playing was taken up, as we saw, in the first
half of the seventeenth century, and even before, by the
Italians. It was at first used only as an orchestral instrument
and as a harmonised accompaniment of recitative
singing in the place of the gamba. But in the second half of
the seventeenth century there were some Italian artists, as
<span class="smcap">Gabrieli</span>, <span class="smcap">Ariosti</span>, and <span class="smcap">Bononcini</span>, who endeavoured to
elevate the violoncello to the rank of a solo instrument. Then
appeared <span class="smcap">Franciscello</span>, who worked with uncommon success
to the same end. By the last three named artists violoncello
playing was presented to the German nation with the idea of
artistically treating it, while in France Giov. Battista
Struck, called Baptistin, exercised an influence in the same
direction.</p>

<p>In both these countries this new branch of Art soon
received a great impulse by means of native talent. The
Germans brought to it more that was empiric, the French
what was methodic&mdash;consequently at the beginning, it must
be acknowledged, the latter gained a certain advantage. It
is very noteworthy that they made great efforts to arrange
systematically and establish the technique of violoncello
playing by instruction books and methods, and Corrette led
the way with his violoncello school, published in 1741, which
was followed in the course of the second half of the last
century by similar works by Tillière, Cupis, and Müntzberger.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
In Italy and Germany, as far as one can see, the first attempts
at instruction books for the violoncello were initiated after
Corrette and Tillière had published their Schools.</p>

<p>But in spite of the laudable efforts which were made,
especially in France, to establish the science of cello playing
on a sure and suitable basis, it made very slow progress. A
substantial hindrance existed from the circumstance that the
method of violin playing, which, at the time, had already
reached a high state of cultivation, had been in a measure used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
as a model without taking into consideration the important
difference in the dimensions of the fingerboard in the two
instruments. Not only had the fingering of the diatonic and
chromatic scales, but also the principles of the so-called
positions, been transferred from the violin to the violoncello.
With reference to the first point, the necessary directions
were given by description in the Method of Corrette. As to
the latter point it must be observed that for the lower portion
of the fingerboard four different positions were adopted
analogous to the technique of the violin. To this position-theory,
which has come down to the present time and is
treated of in some of the old as well as the new violoncello
schools, no special authority, strictly speaking, should be
attached.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> For the violin it has to a certain extent a meaning,
as on that instrument it is possible to play a complete scale on
all parts of the fingerboard without moving the hand. On
account of its wider dimensions the violoncello admits of this
only by the help of the thumb position, with the exception of
the C major scale by using the open strings. But even here,
where an indication of position would be applicable, it is not
usual. Evidently there is something inconsistent in this.</p>

<p>There was a singular conjuncture with regard to finger
technique in the use of the thumb, as we have already seen
from Corrette’s violoncello school. The fourth finger was
excluded from co-operation as soon as the use of the thumb
was introduced, because it was thought that it was too short.
This view of it prevailed up to the end of last century. In the
method published by the Belgian violoncellist, Müntzberger,
it is literally said: “When the fourth position has been passed
over, only three fingers are used.” Later indeed, where
Müntzberger speaks of the use of the thumb, he somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
modifies this rule, since he remarks: “Many professors, when
using the thumb, do not need the fourth finger. I am of
opinion that its use should not be rejected, in that he, who by
nature is endowed with a long finger, can make it available in
certain cases.”</p>

<p>In exceptional cases, therefore, Müntzberger advocated
the use of the little finger when playing with the assistance
of the thumb. But it is evident from his expression
that the use of it was not usual at the end of the last century.
This is undoubtedly to be gathered from the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méthode
de Violoncelle</span>,” published conjointly by Baillot, Levasseur,
Catel, and Baudiot. In it is the following observation: “The
use of the fourth finger in the different positions of the thumb
was not known to the older violoncello teachers of France. It
has only been introduced a few years, since the necessity for it
has been felt.” As this violoncello school was in 1804 accepted
as an instruction book for the Conservatoire by a resolution of
the General Committee, it is clearly evident that in France at
least the fourth finger had for the most part remained unused
until shortly before the close of the last century. The cause
of this was plainly an incorrect manipulation. Concerning
the practice pursued in Germany during the second half of
the last century with regard to the fourth finger, Joh. Bap.
Baumgartner’s Tutor, mentioned page <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, would alone be able
to give an explanation, if it were still extant. With some
probability, however, it may be assumed that the same opinion
was held in reference to it as on the other side of the Rhine.
The influence of France on German violoncello playing in the
second half of the last century made itself felt in other ways.
This was chiefly through the means of the brothers Duport.
The succeeding sections will show in what way the further
cultivation of this branch of the art progressed.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;ITALY.</h3>


<p>The most important epoch of Italian violoncello playing
came to a close with Boccherini. His early withdrawal from
his native land caused a loss all the more sensibly felt because
there was no one of equal importance to compensate for him
in the further development of the art, from the point to which
he had attained both in its executive and productive aspect.
This task fell principally to Germans, French, and Belgians,
whilst Italy was deprived of the position of pre-eminence in
regard to violoncello playing which she is asserted to have
held for a long time in the previous century. The same
phenomenon consequently was repeated here as in regard to
violin playing.</p>

<p>Already towards the end of the eighteenth century Art, and
especially instrumental music, in which the Italians had
accomplished so much that was praiseworthy, fell into decline
on the Apennine Peninsula&mdash;although Italy brought out some
important productions, particularly in the department of
opera compositions. The Musical Almanack for Germany, of
1783, contains the correspondence of an anonymous German
artist who travelled in Italy in the year 1782. It is there
said: “At Naples I found in the Conservatoire<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> a veritable
horror. Caffaro<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> is here with Milico, whose music gave me
the most pleasure. As for the rest it is all miserable, heavy,
modern Italian opera music, as well as in the churches. I
hoped to find a great deal at Venice, but it is no better there.
Above all, the execution in the whole of Italy is less good than
formerly.... But what astonishes me most is the extraordinarily
little appreciation of music in Italy now. It is
almost a miracle to see people of position who have a love of
music. It created a great sensation when we gave concerts
in Rome which were frequented by sincere admirers and friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Instrumental music is at such a low ebb that it is almost
beneath any criticism.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of the present century things were not
changed in this respect. Louis Spohr, who was in Italy in
1816, expresses himself in his autobiography concerning the
condition of music there much in the same manner as the
anonymous writer cited above, and, a little later, Felix
Mendelssohn Bartholdy likewise.</p>

<p>Under these conditions it cannot excite surprise if Italy
in consequence did not produce so many representatives
of violoncello playing in the highest sense of the word as
hitherto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luigi Venzano</span> must be mentioned as one of the first
distinguished Italian cellists of this century. He was born in
Genoa about 1815, and was solo cellist in the orchestra of the
Theatre Carlo Felice, as well as teacher at the musical
institute of his native town. He died on January 27, 1878.
As a composer he devoted himself to vocal and stage
compositions.</p>

<p>An incomparably more important player than the preceding
artist, or his countrymen to be subsequently mentioned,
is <span class="smcap">Alfredo Piatti</span>, born at Bergamo on January 8, 1822, and
not in 1823, as Fétis says. His father, who died on
February 27, 1878, and who early instructed him in music,
was not a singer but a violin player.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The boy soon decided
for the violoncello, on which he received his first lessons from
his great uncle, Zanetti, who was engaged as music master at
Bergamo.</p>

<p>Later he was sent to Milan for the benefit of the Conservatoire.
Here the excellent violoncellist, Merighi, conducted
his further education. Piatti attended the above-named
Institution until September, 1837, after having appeared previous
to this date at one of the concerts with decided success.
In April, 1838, he gave a concert of his own in the Teatro
della Scala, at Milan, with the profits of which he supplied
himself with the means of undertaking a concert tour. Soon
after he was heard very favourably at Venice and Vienna. In
the latter town he remained some time; then he returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Italy and gave concerts at Milan and Padua. In 1843 he
went to Munich and joined in a concert with Liszt there. In
the following year he presented himself at Frankfort-on-the-Maine,
Berlin, Breslaw, and Dresden, when he afterwards
visited Paris. In 1845 he was in St. Petersburg, where his
performances met with unusual appreciation. Having returned
to Milan, the post of teacher was offered to him, in 1846, at
the Conservatoire. He did not, however, accept the offer, but
established himself in the same year in the English capital,
which from that time he has only left occasionally, either to
undertake concerts or journeys to recruit his health. In
London he soon became one of the most distinguished artistic
celebrities, and he still remains in full favour with the public.
His performances are proportionably marked by fine tone, the
greatest purity, tasteful rendering, as well as by a perfect
mastery of all technical difficulties. He is not only the most
important cellist in England, but belongs altogether to the
highest rank of artists of the present time. He wrote for his
instrument two Concertos (Op. 24 and 26), a Concertino
(Op. 18), a “Fantasia romantica,” Capriccios (Op. 22 and 25),
a “Sérénade Italienne” (Op. 17), “Airs Baskyrs” (Op. 8), as
well as a long list of other works, consisting of Themes with
variations and drawing-room pieces of various kinds. Further
he has brought out new editions of old cello compositions and
six Sonatas by Boccherini. He has also published original
songs with violoncello obbligato.</p>

<p>Two other pupils of the Milan Conservatoire are <span class="smcap">Guglielmo
Quarenghi</span> and <span class="smcap">Alessandro Pezze</span>. The first, born on
October 22, 1826, in Casal Maggiore, was pursuing his studies
during the years 1839-1842. Arrived at maturity he was
first violoncellist at the Teatro della Scala, at Milan, and
from 1851 he gave instruction also at the Conservatoire to
which he was indebted for his education. In February, 1879,
he took the place of Boucheron as Choirmaster at the
Cathedral. He enjoyed this position only a few years, for he
died February 3 or 4, 1882. Amongst his compositions the
most noteworthy are&mdash;Six Capriccios, a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chant elégiaque</span>,”
with piano accompaniment; two Romances, a Scherzo, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Un
pensiero al lago</span>,” and some Fantasias on <i>Motifs</i> from Italian
operas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alessandro Pezze</span>, born 1835, at Milan, received from his
father, a clever dilettante, his first musical instruction, after
which, in 1846, he went to the Conservatoire of his native
town. Merighi directed his violoncello studies. After he had
been for some time first cellist at the Teatro della Scala, he
was engaged by the English impresario, Lumley, for
Her Majesty’s Theatre in London. Pezze belonged to it
until 1867, in which year the theatre was destroyed by fire.
Later this artist was employed in the orchestras of the Philharmonic
Society and Covent Garden. He is still living in
London.</p>

<p>The Naples Conservatoire produced <span class="smcap">Gaetano Braga</span>, born
on June 9, 1829, at Guilianuova in the Abruzzi. He was
originally destined for the church, but the inclination for
music came out so strongly that he could not be kept back from
it. His parents now wished that he should be educated as a
singer; he, however, decided for the violoncello, on which
Gaetano Ciandelli directed his studies. He soon became a
pupil of Mercadante for composition. In the year 1852 he
had finished his studies at the Conservatoire. Soon after he
undertook a concert journey to the North of Italy, and from
thence to Vienna, where he formed a connection with Mayseder,
and was a member of his String Quartet for a short time. In
1855 he betook himself to Paris, where he was much in
request as a favourite solo player. He is at present living in
Florence. As a composer Braga devoted himself by preference
to stage compositions. For the violoncello he only
wrote a Concerto, and some smaller pieces with piano
accompaniment, and a Serenade for voice with cello accompaniment.</p>

<p>Other Italian violoncellists at the present time worthy of
notice are&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ronchini</span> and <span class="smcap">G. Magrini</span> in Milan, <span class="smcap">Pini</span> in Venice,
<span class="smcap">Serato</span> in Bologna, <span class="smcap">Toscanini</span> in Parma, <span class="smcap">Sbolci</span> and <span class="smcap">Castagnoli</span>
in Florence, <span class="smcap">Furino</span> in Rome, <span class="smcap">Centola</span> in Naples, <span class="smcap">Montecchi</span>
(who lives at present at Rennes in Bretagne as a music
teacher), and <span class="smcap">Mattioli</span>, now in Cincinnati.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<h3>V.&mdash;GERMANY</h3>


<p>German violoncello playing had, during the second half of
last century, found unusual opportunities for expansion in
consequence of the demand for numberless competent artists
for the various princely households, as well as for the larger
towns. Amongst the cellists mentioned in the second part
of this work, there were already some specially prominent personages
to distinguish. The branch of art, however, to which
this book is devoted first received a really important and
sustained impulse through means of <span class="smcap">Bernhard Romberg</span>. This
artist acquired for German violoncello playing a significance
similar to that which Louis Spohr gained for German violin
playing, only with this difference&mdash;that the latter master was
far superior to the former as a composer. While certain
violin compositions of Spohr (not to speak of his other works),
on account of their intrinsic worth, are calculated to appear in
concert programmes, and will presumably do so in the future,
the cello pieces by Romberg have already for some time completely
disappeared from them. Yet they have, from a scholastic
point of view, proved to be of value even to the present day. In
regard to this, what Romberg did for the cultivation and
perfecting, as well as the fine manipulation of his instrument,
merits for him the appellation of founder of the German
school of violoncello playing. His Concertos and concert
pieces have been of more importance, however, for taking such
a direction than his violoncello school, which by no means
belongs to the best instruction books of the kind, and is a
proof that a man can be a distinguished teacher&mdash;and Romberg
was in any case this&mdash;without having the capacity for the
production of a thoroughly satisfactory instruction book.
The examples and music pieces in Romberg’s violoncello
school are indeed excellent, but some of the maxims which he
enunciates seem peculiar, and he goes too much into
extraneous matter, instead of bringing forward the more
substantial principles with the necessary precision and
accuracy.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that Romberg advocated a simplified
notation for violoncello music. Primarily (besides the bass
clef), in Italy and Germany, only the tenor clef was used, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the alto clef in France. But as the compass of violoncello
playing was more and more extended up to the high parts of
the scale, by the use of the thumb positions, keys used for the
discant and violin were added. Boccherini, for the notation
of many of his compositions, made use altogether of five clefs,
sometimes indeed in one and the same piece&mdash;as, for example,
at the opening <i>Allegro</i> of his Concerto (C major). There was
nothing arbitrary in this procedure. Boccherini had far
more in view the object of giving to the player starting-points
for the finger positions to be used in each case. In his
later compositions, however, he abandoned this, as the use of
so many different clefs had its inconveniences; and he
restricted himself to the use of the bass, tenor, and violin clef.
This notation was subsequently generally accepted, particularly
also by Romberg, and is still in use up to the present
time. In opposition to the earlier favourite manner of
writing the notes&mdash;by the use of the violin clef an octave too
high for the violoncello, as is the case in Mozart’s and
Beethoven’s compositions&mdash;Boccherini, by the application of
the clefs mentioned, wrote everything as it would sound. By
this means he gained the advantage that he was not obliged
to make so much use of ledger lines in the writing of his
passages&mdash;which were continually moving in the soprano part&mdash;as
he must have done if he had followed the custom of his
contemporaries and had adhered to the higher system of
notation. It is readily understood why Romberg in his
cello school should declare himself in favour of the change
introduced by Boccherini, for he also, with special predilection,
made use of the higher regions of the fingerboard for his
playing; wherefore it was said of him that his handling of
the violoncello was often after the manner of the violin.
From this point of view it is thoroughly rational that
Romberg, in regard to notation, should follow the example given
by Boccherini. In later times the too frequent and continuous
use of the soprano clef&mdash;in which a broad, energetic
volume of tone, full of expression, is nearly excluded&mdash;has been
abandoned without, however, being neglected entirely; while
to the most beautiful and effective clef&mdash;namely, the tenor&mdash;has
been accorded its right place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bernhard Romberg</span> was the son of the bassoon player,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Anton Romberg, of some note in his time, and was born on
November 11, 1767, in the village of Dinklage, near the little
Prussian town of Quakenbrück. It is unknown whom he had
as teacher for the violoncello. It was probably an orchestra
musician in Münster, to which place his parents had removed
their home. In any case, Romberg’s talent caused him to
make the most of it, for before he had passed his youth he
was able to undertake with his cousin, Andreas Romberg,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
who was about the same age, a concert tour which led them
through Holland, and was extended to Paris, where they were
both heard with such success in the house of Baron Bagge<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
that they were engaged in 1787 for the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concert Spirituel</span>.”
After his return from Paris Romberg devoted himself eagerly
to progressive studies, and at the same time worked in the
orchestra at Münster.</p>

<p>Münster belonged then, as is known, to the Electorate of
Cologne. The Elector Maximilian Franz, who on his
accession to his dominions (April 27, 1784) resided often in the
Westphalian town, had his attention drawn to the two
Romberg artists, and engaged them for his Royal band at
Bonn. The announcement of the appointment bears the date
of December 19, 1790.</p>

<p>When the Elector, in the autumn of the following year,
went to reside at Mergentheim, then the seat of the German
order&mdash;whose Grand Master he was&mdash;he caused about twenty
members of his band to follow him from Bonn. Amongst
them, besides Beethoven, who in addition to his office as
organist was also tenor player at the Court, were also the two
Rombergs. In one of the musical entertainments which took
place in the apartments of the Elector, Bernhard Romberg
was heard in a Concerto. Boszler’s Musical Correspondence
of the year 1791 contains a notice of it in which is said<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>:
“Romberg, the younger, combines in his violoncello playing
extraordinary rapidity with charming rendering; this rendering
is the more marked and decided when he is heard in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
connection with the greater number of violoncellists. The tone
which he produces from his instrument is, moreover&mdash;especially
in the expressive parts&mdash;extremely clear, firm, and penetrating.
Taking into consideration the difficulty of the instrument, a
thoroughly marked purity of tone, in the extraordinarily quick
rendering of the <i>Allegro</i>, must be attributed to him in the
highest degree. Yet this after all is mere mechanical readiness;
the connoisseur has another standard by which he
measures the greatness of artists; and this is, the manner of
playing, the perfection of expression or the spiritual interpretation.
Once on this point, the connoisseur will pronounce
in favour of the expressive <i>Adagio</i>. It is impossible more
deeply to penetrate into the more delicate hues of feeling&mdash;impossible
to colour them with more variety&mdash;to enhance them,
moreover, by greater light and shade&mdash;impossible to hit more
exactly the very tones through which this feeling has utterance,
tones which appeal more directly to the heart than Romberg
succeeds in doing in his <i>Adagio</i>.”</p>

<p>“How acquainted he is with all the beauties of detail, which
lie in the nature of the piece in the peculiar kind of expression
to be given, and for which the composer has no signs for
recognition? What effects he is able to produce by the
<i>crescendo</i> of his tone, swelling up to the strongest <i>fortissimo</i>,
and then again by its dying away to a scarcely audible
<i>pianissimo</i>!!”</p>

<p>From this enthusiastic announcement we must conclude
that Romberg’s playing at that time&mdash;he was in his twenty-fourth
year&mdash;showed already a high degree of perfection. It
is therefore quite conceivable that he cherished the wish of
obtaining a position in life adequate to the merit of his performances,
for in Bonn he received only a yearly salary of 600
florins, and, moreover, the existence of the Cologne Electorate,
the complete dissolution of which was accomplished in the
autumn of the year 1794, had fallen into a very doubtful
condition from the time of the appearance of the revolutionary
army on the Rhine (October, 1792).</p>

<p>Romberg therefore accepted with his cousin, Andreas, at
Easter, 1794, an engagement at the Schröder Theatre in
Hamburg, but he did not long remain there. Three years
later they undertook together a concert journey into Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
gave concerts on their return at Vienna, supported by
Beethoven, and again betook themselves to Hamburg, whence,
after a two years’ residence, Bernhard Romberg visited
London. He next travelled in Portugal and Spain, in 1800
returned again to Paris, and performed this time at the
concerts of “La Rue de Cléry” and the “Théâtre des Victoires”
with such great success that he became teacher at the
Conservatoire. Romberg does not, however, appear to have
felt comfortable in this position, for after two years he
withdrew from it and again turned to Hamburg. In 1805 he
responded to an invitation to be solo cellist at the Berlin
Hofcappelle. The calamities of war, which broke over Prussia
in the following year, compelled him once more to become a
wanderer. He next visited the Austrian States. After the
conclusion of the peace of Tilsit, he found himself again in
Berlin, remained there up to the year 1810, and then undertook
a journey through Silesia, Poland, and Russia. At
St. Petersburg he met with Ferd. Ries, and in conjunction
with him gave concerts in the Southern provinces of the
Czar’s dominions. The artists wished to arrange a visit to
Moscow, but were prevented by the memorable burning of the
Kremlin which compelled the French army to retreat. They
then turned to Stockholm, and from thence went to Copenhagen
and Hamburg. Here they separated&mdash;Ries went to
London, which he reached in March, 1813, and Romberg took
his way by Bremen to Holland and Belgium. From the
latter country he again visited Paris for a short time.
Returned to Germany, Romberg prepared for a second journey
to Russia. On this occasion he lingered two years at Moscow.
After he had been, from 1815-1819, in the service of the Berlin
Court, he chose Hamburg as his settled residence. Wherever
Romberg played his highly finished performances excited
great enthusiasm. In this his violoncello compositions&mdash;which
were entirely in accordance with the taste of that period
in a virtuoso point of view, and which, moreover, were distinguished
by their solid quality above all other cello
compositions of the time&mdash;had a substantial share.</p>

<p>During his many journeys through European countries,
Romberg had collected national airs, of which he availed himself
in various ways for his compositions under different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
names. Amongst them are to be found Caprices on Swedish,
Polish, Moldavian, Wallachian, and Spanish songs, as well as
a “Fantaisie” on Norwegian and a “Rondo brilliant” on Polish
melodies, besides four books of Variations on Russian national
airs. He further wrote ten Concertos, three Concertinos, a
Fantasia with orchestra, Polonaises, as well as Duets and
Sonatas, with bass accompaniment for the cello. He was
also very productive in the sphere of chamber music, and
composed also for the stage. These last compositions have,
however, not survived him, while, on the other hand, his cello
pieces, as already noticed, maintain even at this time a
certain value for teaching.</p>

<p>There have been certain famous artists who in advanced
age, in spite of a considerable decay in their capacity for
performance, have unwisely indulged the inclination of still
endeavouring to attract admiration. Bernhard Romberg was
one of these. In his seventy-third year he again had a desire
to visit Paris in order&mdash;though not in public&mdash;to appear in
artistic circles as a solo player. The failure which he experienced
appears to have had a prejudicial effect on his health,
for he died soon after his return home, on August 13, 1841.</p>

<p>Romberg promoted the advancement of German violoncello
playing chiefly by his activity as a soloist, and also
by his compositions, for, on account of his many concert
journeys, which led him sometimes in one direction and
sometimes in another, he had not sufficient leisure for
continuous and regular teaching. A few young artists,
however, enjoyed the benefit of his instruction. Of these we
will mention only here his nephew, Cyprian, and Julius
Schapler. Some others will be noticed farther on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julius Schapler</span> was born on August 21, 1812, in
Graudenz.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> He received his musical education in Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cyprian Romberg</span>, born in 1807 (according to other accounts,
1810), in Hamburg, made himself known, after he had
finished his studies, by his journeys in Germany and Austria,
and was then a member of the Imperial band at St. Petersburg.
In Hamburg, where he spent the last years of his life, he
was, unfortunately, drowned while bathing in the Elbe in 1865.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
B. Romberg was at first his master for the violoncello, on
which also he received instruction from the pensioned
chamber musician, Hansmann.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> After his education was
concluded Schapler was heard as solo player in the Opera
House at Berlin, as well as in the Gewandhaus at Leipsic, with
great applause. He declined offers for engagements, which
were in consequence proposed to him, as he wished to make
himself known by concerts. Soon after, however, when
the position of solo player in the Court band of the
Duke of Nassau was offered to him he accepted it. In
Wiesbaden, besides his official duties, he was much occupied
with composition. The fruits of it were not only several
cello pieces, but also three greater chamber music works&mdash;namely,
a String Quartet, a Trio for piano and violoncello,
as well as a Quintet for piano, violin, tenor violoncello, and
contra-basso. These last compositions were all crowned with
success. A warm and appreciative critique of the String
Quartet appeared in 1842 from the pen of Robert Schumann,
in his musical paper.</p>

<p>The unquiet year, 1848, caused the Duke of Nassau
to dismiss the members of his Kapelle (without pensions).
Schapler returned to his home and created for himself
a lucrative field of work as music teacher in Thorn,
to which he devoted himself for many years. At the present
time he is living privately in Berlin.</p>

<p>Schapler belonged in his prime to the best violoncellists
of Germany. With fine tone-rendering he had complete
mastery over his instrument. Unfortunately, he did not
succeed, after his departure from Wiesbaden, in obtaining
a post worthy of his excellent performances.</p>

<p>While Bernhard Romberg was raising to a position of
high honour the art of violoncello playing in Germany,
several important centres were forming for it in Dresden
and Vienna.</p>

<p>The Dresden Court, which had always done a great deal for
music, was continually taking into consideration the means of
attracting into its neighbourhood distinguished instrumentalists;
and if for some time a succession of foreign, but specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Italian artists found a place there, a certain amount of gain
was the result in connection with it&mdash;for the artist youth of
Germany received thereby a progressive impulse to their own
endeavours. The Dresden Court orchestra had already, in the
last century, a distinguished reputation, and this was more and
more enhanced by the continual influx of talented and highly
gifted musicians. As regarded the violoncello especially, it
gained not long after the beginning of our century an exemplary
representative in <span class="smcap">Dotzauer</span>. From that time until the present
day Dresden has remained an important centre for violoncello
playing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Justus Johann Friedrich Dotzauer</span>, born on January 20,
1783, at Häselrieth, near Hildburghausen, was the son of a
minister there. Instructed early in music, he devoted himself
to the piano, violin, and violoncello playing. The latter
soon gained the ascendancy, and as the inclination for an
artistic career showed itself decisively in him, his father sent
him, in the year 1799, to Kriegk,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> at Meiningen, under whose
direction he studied two years. After the expiration of that
period he found a post in the Meiningen Kapelle until 1805,
when he went to Leipsic, and from 1805-1811 he was a
member of the orchestra.</p>

<p>From Leipsic he visited Berlin. Here he heard Romberg,
with advantage for the pursuit of his studies. In the year
1811 he accepted an honourable position in the Dresden Court
orchestra, to which he belonged, from 1821-1850, as first solo
cellist. He then lived in retirement, which he enjoyed for ten
years. He died in the place where he had successfully
worked for so many years on March 6, 1860.</p>

<p>Dotzauer was also well-skilled in composition, and attempted
it in various forms. He wrote an Opera, Overtures,
Symphonies, a Mass, and several chamber pieces. All these
productions have long been forgotten. Not so his violoncello
works, which consist of nine Concertos, three Concertinos, two
Sonatas with bass, Variations, Divertissements, Potpourris,
and a great number of Duets, some of these at least are still
prized as objects of study. This is especially the case with
regard to his books of instruction, to which belong two violoncello<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
schools,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> as well as a number of exercises of various kinds.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Amongst these the most commendable on account of their
excellence are the eighteen “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Exercices d’une difficulté progressive</span>”
(Op. 120), for beginners (with the exception of the
two last numbers), and the “Twenty-four Daily Studies for
the acquiring and keeping of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Virtuosität</span>.” The latter work
is in every respect by far the best of Dotzauer’s many studies.
He also published a School for Flageolet playing (Op. 147).
His performances combined the gifts of great solidity and
fascinating sweetness. Of his two sons, the younger, Carl
Ludwig, devoted himself to the violoncello under the direction
of his father. In 1820 he was member of the Hofkapelle at
Cassel. He was born on December 7, 1811, at Dresden.</p>

<p>Dotzauer was distinguished not only as an executant artist
but also as a teacher. The most remarkable of his scholars
are&mdash;Kummer, Schuberth, Voigt, and Drechsler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedrich August Kummer</span> was born on August 15, 1797, at
Meiningen. His father, an accomplished oboist, belonged to
the Ducal band there. At the beginning of the century he
entered the Hofkapelle at Dresden, and here his son, who
at first had taken up his father’s instrument, became Dotzauer’s
pupil. When his education was completed on the violoncello,
Kummer should have been admitted into the Dresden Hofkapelle;
but as there was just then no vacancy for his
instrument he was obliged for a while to content himself with
being received as oboist. This was in 1814. Three years
later he was enrolled among the cellists. By diligently
prosecuted studies, Kummer gradually reached such a high
degree of artistic cultivation that when Dotzauer was pensioned,
he was appointed in his place as first violoncellist of the
Royal band. In 1864 he celebrated his fiftieth Jubilee, and
then gave himself up to his well-deserved retirement. During
his long tenure of office he displayed a most extraordinary
activity as soloist, quartet, and orchestra player, as well as
teacher. In the latter capacity he worked both privately and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
at the Dresden Conservatoire, to which he belonged, until his
death, which took place on May 22, 1879. At the same time
he wrote a good deal for his instrument, a Concerto, two
Concertinos, instructive Duets (some easy and others more
difficult), Variations, Etudes, Caprices, Studies (amongst them,
daily ones), diverse musical “Divertissements,” which were
formerly much in request amongst dilletanti, some of which
are still used as subjects for the practice of youthful players.
He also produced a violoncello school. It is at present the
most generally used work of the kind, short and clear, though
only extending to a moderate degree of difficulty; finally,
Kummer published a useful compendium: “Repertorium and
Orchestral Studies,” containing important and difficult cello
pieces from oratorios, symphonies, overtures, and operas.
Kummer’s playing bore the stamp of great precision and
correctness, united to powerful and solid intonation. His
technique “was in every point thoroughly cultivated, but to
acquire the ‘finesses’ of a virtuoso he was of too simple a
nature, which was better calculated to occupy itself with the
sphere of music in its intellectual aspect than in brilliant
display. All that he produced on his instrument was most
correct and defined, in which he was greatly assisted by his
quiet and cautious temperament. He was unable indeed
to raise himself to the height of poetical inspiration and
unrestrained warmth of expression, though he never did
violence to a good composition. His manner of rendering
was always strictly objective and according to rule.” Amongst
Kummer’s pupils Cossmann and Julius Goltermann are
prominent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bernhard Cossmann</span>, born on May 17, 1822, in Dessau,
studied at first under Theodore Müller, the cellist of the
formerly famous Müller String Quartet, at Brunswick, and then
under Kummer. During the years 1840-1841 he worked in
the orchestra of the Grand Opéra in Paris, after which he went
to London. In 1848 he was engaged as solo player for the
Leipsic (Gewandhaus) Concert, in 1852 taken to Weimar by
Franz Liszt, and in 1866 appointed teacher of cello playing to
the Conservatoire at Moscow. From 1870 to 1878 Cossmann
lived privately in Baden-Baden and only appeared to play at
concerts. When the Conservatoire at Hoch was founded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
1878, the office of teacher of his instrument was entrusted to
him, which post he now occupies. Cossmann belongs to the
best cellists of the present time. He has a fine, distinct tone,
manages the fingerboard with ease, and is not only a distinguished
solo player but also an excellent quartet player.
Amongst his compositions the most worthy of notice are
a Concert piece with piano accompaniment, three “Fantasias”
on <i>Motifs</i> from the “Freischütz,” “Tell,” and
“Euryanthe,” six Solos in two parts, a Swiss Melody and a
Neapolitan Canzonet, three Pieces (Op. 8), Etudes de Concert
(Op. 10), and Violoncello Studies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann August Goltermann</span>, born on July 25, 1825, in
Hamburg, after he had perfected himself under Kummer, was
appointed to the Prague Conservatoire, to which he belonged
from 1850 to 1862. In the latter year he exchanged this
employment for that of first solo cellist in the Stuttgart
orchestra. In 1870 he was pensioned, and on April 4, 1876, he
died. He was an able artist in his branch of it.</p>

<p>The next pupil of Dotzauer to be mentioned is <span class="smcap">Carl
Schuberth</span>, born on February 25, 1811, in Magdeburg. He
received at first, from a musician of his native town named
Hesse, six years instruction, and then repaired to Dresden to
Dotzauer, with whom he remained two years. On his return
home he made his <i>début</i> with success as a soloist at a concert
organised by Catalani, in Magdeburg. At the end of 1828 he
undertook a concert tour to the North. The destination was
Copenhagen, where, in the spring of 1829, he arrived and
made a prolonged sojourn. Later on Schuberth occupied the
position of first violoncellist at the Magdeburg Theatre, gave
it up, however, in 1833, and undertook, in the autumn of the
same year, a journey through Western Germany and Belgium.
From the latter place he visited Paris. In the following year
he went to Holland, and during the season of 1835 he was
heard in London. Schuberth then went to St. Petersburg,
where he found, as elsewhere, a brilliant reception, and
immediately a permanent position, for he was not only named
Director of the Imperial band, but also Inspector of the
Music School affiliated to the Court Theatre and Director of
Music at the University. He filled these posts until 1863, in
which year death overtook him during a journey for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
benefit of his health, on July 22, at Zurich. Schuberth’s
playing was exceedingly clever, but in expression more elegant
and ornamental than impressive. His cello pieces give
evidence of this, which, with the exception of a Concerto,
belong to the description of so-called conversazione music;
but they have not survived their author. Amongst his pupils
the most remarkable is Carl Davidoff.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carl Louis Voigt</span>, the third of Dotzauer’s pupils above-mentioned,
was born on November 8, 1792, at Zeitz; he was
the son of the organist at St. Thomas’s Church, Leipsic, Joh.
Georg Hermann Voigt. He played several instruments, and
amongst others the violoncello also, on which his grandfather,
Johann Heinr. Viktor Rose,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> had given him instruction at
Quedlinburg. Besides his work as organist, he played the
violoncello with the orchestra of the theatre in the Gewandhaus
at Leipsic. He imparted to his son what he knew and
was able to do as cellist, who, in order to perfect himself,
studied under Dotzauer’s direction some time, and in 1811 took
the latter’s place in the Leipsic Orchestra, to which he had
belonged since the winter of 1809-1810. Voigt filled this post
until his death, which took place on February 21, 1831. His
violoncello compositions extant, consisting of Sonatas, Duets,
Exercises, and a diversity of Drawing-room Pieces, are feeble,
but may be used for instruction&mdash;as, for example, the three
Sonatas (Op. 40).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carl Drechsler</span>, finally, born on May 27, 1800, at Camenz,
in the kingdom of Saxony, early studied violoncello playing.
He began his career as a military musician at Dessau. At the
same time he assisted as cellist in the orchestra there. Through
the recommendation of Friedrich Schneider, who discerned the
young man’s talent, the Duke of Dessau granted him the
means, in 1824, of placing himself under Dotzauer’s direction
for further cultivation. After this he undertook a long concert
tour. The great success of this caused his name to be well
known, with the result that, in the year 1826, he was permanently
established in the orchestra at Dessau, with the title
of Concertmaster.</p>

<p>Drechsler’s performances were characterised as much by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
faultless purity and refinement as by feeling and tasteful
rendering. His playing was not powerful, but pleasing by
its grace and delicacy. He was everywhere received with
welcome, and, as he responded to all that was demanded
as an excellent leader of his instrument in the orchestra,
he was an eagerly sought guest at all musical festivals.
After he was pensioned, in 1871, he chose Dresden as
his residence. He did not, however, long enjoy the amenities
of retirement, for he died in the year 1873.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="smcap">Louis</span>, born on October 5, 1822, at Dessau, formed
himself under the direction of his father as a clever violoncellist.
He lived and worked as such for a long time in
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Drechsler, the father, was an excellent teacher. Through
him Dessau was for a time affiliated to the Dresden school of
cello playing, in which he educated excellent artists, amongst
whom the best known are Lindner and Grützmacher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">August Lindner</span>,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> born on October 29, 1820, at Dessau,
after he had completed his studies, was appointed, in the year
1837, to the Hofkapelle at Hanover, to which he belonged
until his death (June, 1878). He enjoyed the reputation of a
distinguished violoncellist. Of his compositions we must
mention a Concerto (Op. 34), Nine Drawing-room Pieces
(Op. 18), Six Fantasias (Op. 38), Divertissements for young
cellists (two parts, Op. 32), Concert au Salon (two parts),
Three Paraphrases on <i>Motifs</i> from Meyerbeer’s “Huguenots”
and “Le Prophète,” as well as Verdi’s “Ernani” (Op. 12),
and a long list of Opera Potpourris. Besides these, Lindner
produced a new edition of L. Duport’s “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Essai sur le doigter
du Violoncelle</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>His pupil, <span class="smcap">Bernhard Thieme</span>, born on June 11, 1854, in
Altenburg, began his musical career after he left school,
under the town musician at Penig, in Saxony, and when at
eighteen he returned home from there, he received cello
instruction, for a short time, from the Kapellmeister, Toller.
He very soon found employment in the Berlin Orchestra.
He then went, as first cellist, with the Fliegen Orchestra, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
a summer, to St. Petersburg, in the same capacity; a few months
later he entered the Bückeburg Kapelle. He was subsequently
occupied in the Hofkapelle at Hanover for two years, and
during this period he enjoyed the excellent teaching of Aug.
Lindner. Since 1879 he has filled the place of solo cellist in
the town orchestra at Baden-Baden.</p>

<p>The Dresden school of cello playing, founded by Dotzauer,
and continued by Kummer, received a still greater forward
impulse through <span class="smcap">Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Grützmacher</span>.</p>

<p>This far-famed artist, whose efficiency was a great
ornament to the Dresden “Kapellinstitute,” was born on
March 1, 1832, in Dessau, and after he had learned from his
father, who was an esteemed member of the Ducal band,
the elements of music, benefited from the instruction of Carl
Drechsler. Thus the teaching of Dotzauer, whose pupil Carl
Drechsler was at the place whence it had emanated, was
further developed&mdash;a most valuable gain for the artistic life
of the Court of Saxony.</p>

<p>Grützmacher came to Leipsic in the year 1848, fundamentally
well prepared for his vocation, and entered a private
choral society in order to be thoroughly conversant with the
necessary routine in orchestra playing. He was soon invited
to take part in the Gewandhaus and the Euterpe Concerts.
In the latter he made his <i>début</i> at the beginning of
February, 1849, as solo player, with Variations by Franchomme.
The first violoncellist of the Leipsic Gewandhaus
was a certain Wittmann. As, however, his performances
did not fully satisfy, Bernhard Cossmann was engaged in
1848 for the solo parts and for the cello teaching at the
Conservatoire. Then when Cossmann responded to the
invitation to go to Weimar, Grützmacher took his place,
although at the same time he was a regular member of the
opera orchestra. From that period he was the chief representative
of his instrument in Leipsic. Not the less however
did he strive indefatigably to progress in his Art, keeping
unceasingly in view the goal of perfection. How well he
succeeded in reaching it is proved by the dominant position
which he gained and maintained. Julius Rietz, who was
himself an able violoncellist, and had had during his Directorship
in Leipsic many opportunities of observing Grütz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>macher’s
extraordinary executive capacity, rated him very
highly, and was in the habit of admiringly expressing himself
with regard to the incomparable, exemplary and thorough
training of his left hand. It is, therefore, the more intelligible
that he made him every offer possible in order to gain him
for the Dresden Hofkapelle, after he had undertaken its
direction. This happened in 1860, and in the same year
Grützmacher was summoned to Dresden as Kummer’s successor.
From this time he travelled through Germany,
Holland, England, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Denmark, Sweden,
and Russia, and was received everywhere with triumph; but
he was also distinguished in many ways at the place of his
work. In course of time he received from the King of Saxony
the title of Chamber Virtuoso, later he was appointed Royal
Concert leader, and on his twenty-fifth jubilee of service he
was honoured far and wide in manifold ways.</p>

<p>In Grützmacher’s playing were happily united the endowments
of a finished mastery of complex technical difficulties
and delicate manner of expression, more especially in the
rendering of <i>Cantilena</i>. He is not only a virtuoso of the first
rank, but also an excellent interpreter of classical chamber
music. For this latter qualification the foundation had
already been laid by a careful musical education under his
father’s roof, to which Friedrich Schneider had substantially
contributed. He pursued his theoretical studies under the
direction of this master.</p>

<p>Grützmacher published a great number of compositions.
Those which have had the widest circulation are the two
Concertos, Op. 10 (A minor) and Op. 46 (E minor); the Hungarian
Fantasia (Op. 7), the Nocturne (Op. 32), the Scherzo (Op.
30), the Transcriptions of Classical Music (Op. 60), the “Daily
Studies,” the Twenty-four Studies (Op. 38), as well as three
Songs with Violoncello obbligato (Op. 50). He added considerably
to the enrichment of violoncello literature by his
transcriptions of Haydn’s, Mozart’s, Beethoven’s, and Schumann’s
Sonatas, as well as of two of Beethoven’s Violin
Romances, and of Schumann’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kinderscenen</span>.” He further
arranged for the Violoncello the Thirty-six “Songs without
Words” of Mendelssohn, about twelve selected Piano pieces by
Schumann and Chopin, the Violin Sonata (Op. 19) and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Romance (Op. 44) by Rubinstein, the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pensées fugitives</span>”
by Steph. Heller and Ernst, and many other pieces of music.
Grützmacher also brought out new editions of classical and
modern compositions, with the addition of careful annotations.
We must here mention the two Gamba Sonatas of Joh. Seb.
Bach, as well as his six Violoncello Suites; a Gamba Sonata
by Handel and by Phil. Em. Bach, six Boccherini Sonatas
with the addition of a piano accompaniment, a Sonata by
Bonifazio Asioli, some Violoncello Compositions of Beethoven,
Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Chopin; a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thème Russe
varié</span>” by Ferd. Ries, the ten Concertos and six easy Instruction
Pieces for Violoncello by Bernhard Romberg, as well as
twelve Exercises by Dotzauer (Op. 107), with the addition of
a second violoncello part.</p>

<p>In a special manner Grützmacher is deserving of merit by
his highly successful method of instruction in violoncello
playing. Even during his active work in Leipsic he formed
several excellent cellists, whose names are Leopold Grützmacher,
Kahnt, Wilfert, Hilpert, and Hegar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leopold Grützmacher</span>, a younger brother of the cello
master already mentioned, born on September 4, 1835, at
Dessau, was taught cello playing first by Drechsler and then
by his brother, while Fr. Schneider conducted his theoretical
education.</p>

<p>Leopold Grützmacher belonged successively to the Theatre
and Gewandhaus orchestras in Leipsic, to the Court band
at Schwerin, to the orchestra of the German National Theatre
in Prague, and to the Meiningen Court band. From the
latter he was called, in 1876, to Weimar, as solo cellist to
the Grand Ducal Kapelle. Like his brother he was also
distinguished by the title of “Chamber Virtuoso” and “Concertmaster.”
He published for the violoncello two Concertos (Op.
6 and 9) and several smaller, pleasing, and well worked out
compositions.</p>

<p>Leopold Grützmacher educated his son, whose Christian
name was Friedrich, as a cellist. He has already afforded
agreeable proofs of his executive capacity in his public
appearances, and is a member of the Weimar Royal orchestra.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moritz Kahnt</span>, born on April 27, 1836, in Löbnitz (near
Leipsic), received instruction in his parents’ house from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
seventh to his fourteenth year not only on the violin and the
piano, but also on several wind instruments. Later he
devoted himself by preference to violoncello playing, in which
he was Grützmacher’s pupil for three years in the Leipsic
Conservatoire. During the same time he received instruction
at the above-named Institution in composition and the organ.
From the year 1855 he has been first cellist of the Concert
Orchestra, as well as teacher in the school of music at Basle.
Besides his post as organist he superintends the direction of a
Musical Union there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bruno Wilfert</span>, born on July 26, 1836, at Schmalzgrube,
in Saxony, began his education first as violinist under the
town musical director at Kirchberg (in the neighbourhood of
Zwickau), then went with him to Glauchau, and there began
cello playing. Twice a week he journeyed, with his violoncello
under his arm, to the town of Zwickau, three hours distant,
in order to get instruction from the violoncellist, Fr.
Herrmann, a pupil of F. A. Kummer, who belonged to the
town orchestra. Later on he became Grützmacher’s pupil
at Leipsic. By his unceasing industry Wilfert succeeded so
well that in the year 1864 he was appointed solo cellist to the
German Theatre at Prague. Since the foundation of the
Prague Musical Union (1876) he has belonged as a co-operating
member to the Quartet Society. The cello compositions
of Wilfert which have appeared are Two Pieces (Op. 1),
Hungarisch (Op. 2), Fantasia on Airs from the “Masked
Ball” (Op. 3), Two Drawing-room Pieces (Op. 4), and a
“Nocturne” for four Violoncellos (Op. 5).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedrich Hilpert</span>, born March 4, 1841, at Nuremburg, went
to the Leipsic Conservatoire, was there pupil of Grützmacher,
and having finished his studies found an appointment in the
Karlsruhe orchestra. He then went to Zurich, where he made
the acquaintance of the distinguished violinist, Jean Becker
(who died on October 10, 1884); with him, in 1866, in
connection with the Italians Masi and Chiostri as second
violin and tenor, he founded that artistic union which, as the
“Florentine String Quartet,” attained to such great reputation
on account of its excellent performances. In 1875
Hilpert separated from his Quartet companions in order to
take the place, hitherto filled by Röver, which had been offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to him in the Grand Opéra and the Conservatoire at Vienna.
After the lapse of a year, he gave up this appointment
again, and became, under the title of Chamber Virtuoso, a
member of the Meiningen Hofkapelle, and was employed as
soloist in the concert tours under the direction of Hans v.
Bülow. When he relinquished this undertaking, he entered
the Royal orchestra at Munich, to which he still belongs.
Hilpert is reckoned one of the best German cellists of the
present day. The publication arranged by him of a collection
of “classical studies” by Couperin, Rameau, Bach, and
Martini are worthy of notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emil Hegar</span> also, born on January 3, 1843, at Basle,
received his education, like the above-named cellists, from
Grützmacher, at the Leipsic Conservatoire. In the year
1866 he was appointed, on account of his much esteemed
performances, first Violoncellist of the Academy Orchestra,
as well as teacher at the Conservatoire at Leipsic. Compelled
by a nervous affection to abandon entirely, a few
years later, Violoncello playing, he devoted himself to the
study of singing, and became a singing master. He worked
with success as such in the school of music in his native town.
The loss which cello playing sustained in him is proved by his
pupil,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julius Klengel</span>, one of the most excellent and purest
violoncello players of the younger generation. He was born
on September 24, 1859, at Leipsic, and is now working in his
native town as first cellist in the Gewandhaus Concerts and as
teacher at the Conservatoire. Klengel has not only made
himself known outside the sphere of his work by his remarkable
playing, but also as a most attractive composer for his
instrument. Amongst his works we will mention only the
compositions published, as Op. 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, and
20. Of those of his works not numbered must be named a
collection of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unsere Lieblinge</span>,” which contains “the most
charming melodies of ancient and modern times,” cleverly
arranged with piano accompaniment.</p>

<p>A second pupil of Hegar’s is <span class="smcap">Hermann Heberlein</span>, who also
had the advantage of Carl Schröder’s and Bernhard
Cossmann’s instruction. Born on March 29, 1859, at Marckneukirchen,
in the kingdom of Saxony, Heberlein went, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
1873-1877, to the Leipsic Conservatoire. In the last years of
that period he gave concerts in South Germany, and finally was
appointed to be solo cellist at the town theatre of Königsberg.
In 1883 he undertook the office of teacher of his instrument
at the music school there. He wrote “Elementary Studies”
for the Violoncello, “Practical Cello Studies” (2 books, Op. 5),
Variations for the Violoncello, with piano accompaniment
(Op. 2), Two Cello Pieces (Op. 3), four <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pièces de Salon</span> (Op. 6),
and also published a Violoncello school.</p>

<p>The favourable results which had been attained in Leipsic
by Friedrich Grützmacher in the training of his pupils made
him very soon the most attractive teacher in Germany. As
already mentioned, after he had accepted the flattering
invitations made to him to go to Dresden, pupils came to him
from all parts. Only the most famous amongst them are
noticed below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar Eberle</span>, born June 5, 1841, at Krossen, on the Oder,
received from his father, who was town music director, his
first instruction on the cello. At fourteen he had already
made such progress that he was taken into the Bilse
Orchestra, which at that time had its headquarters at Liegnitz.
He belonged to it for five years, in the course of which he was
also employed as soloist in the concerts of the Society. He
was then for two years Grützmacher’s pupil in Dresden;
advancing rapidly under his direction, he attained to artistic
maturity. In 1867 Eberle was summoned to Rotterdam as
teacher to the music school there, as well as solo cellist at
the concerts given by the “<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Matchappy tot bevordering der
Toonkunst</span>.” He was immediately engaged as soloist for the
German Opera at Rotterdam. He retired from the latter post
in 1886. Eberle is an honorary member of the Concert
Society, with which he worked, as well as of the Society
of Students, “Sempre crescendo,” at Leyden, a proof of how
highly his talent is appreciated in Holland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Bellmann</span>, born on June 8, 1844, at Freiburg, in
the kingdom of Saxony, at first benefited by the instruction
of F. A. Kummer, and then went through a course under
Grützmacher, after having for three years frequented
the Conservatoire at Dresden. He then went to Paris, in
order to study composition under the direction of Franc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>homme.
This connection, however, did not last long, as
Bellmann was soon summoned to the Grand Ducal Kapelle at
Schwerin, as first solo cellist. His performances met with such
high appreciation that he was distinguished by the Grand
Duke with the bestowal of the title of Chamber Virtuoso.
In 1878 Bellmann gave up his position at Schwerin, which
he had occupied for twelve years, took up his residence at
Bonn, and was engaged chiefly as a concert player. A short
time after was formed at Cologne the Heckmann String
Quartet, which gained such reputation in recent years during
its tours in Germany, England, and Italy, which Bellmann
joined, and to which he still belongs as a special ornament.</p>

<p>Bellmann must be considered one of the most accomplished
violoncellists of the present time, not only as a soloist, but also
as a quartet player. With complete technical training, his
playing is distinguished by its exemplary purity, rarely fine
tone, its elegance, and its noble and accurate musical
rendering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emil Boerngen</span> spent his youth in Emden, where his father
was music director. He was born on February 2, 1845, at
Verden. He received his first instruction in music from his
father. He then began the study of violoncello playing under
the direction of the chamber virtuoso, C. Mattys, in Hanover.
He obtained, however, his higher education under the direction
of Grützmacher, and had the benefit of his tuition for
three years. In 1870 Boerngen went to Helsingfors. He there
undertook the post of cellist at the theatre. At the same time
he was frequently a much appreciated player both as soloist and
in quartets. Two years after he accepted the invitation to
Strasburg Theatre as solo cellist. After several years of
activity he relinquished his post and went to Salzburg, where
he was engaged for the Mozarteum. Since 1875 he has been
teacher of violoncello playing at the Royal Music School
at Würzburg. In consideration of his successful work at that
Institute, in 1883 he received the title of Professor as a mark
of distinction. During his official activity he was also
occupied as solo and quartet player.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Vollrath</span> was born on December 16, 1848, in the
Thuringian town of Sonneberg, belonging to Saxe-Meiningen,
where his father filled the office of town musician. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
boy early tried several instruments, till he at length showed
his preference for the violoncello. His first teacher was the
royal chamber musician, Roda, at Rudolstadt. During the
years 1865-1867, he studied under the direction of Grützmacher.
Having fulfilled his military term at Coblenz, Vollrath belonged,
from 1871-1873, to the Royal orchestra at Ems as
cellist. In the following winter he joined the Mannsfeld first
orchestra at Dresden. He made use of his residence there to
renew his studies under Grützmacher. He then went as
first cellist for two years into the Wiesbaden orchestra. Since
September, 1876, he has belonged in the same capacity to the
Municipal orchestra at Mainz. Besides his official post he is
also prominent as a solo player and an appreciated teacher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carl. Friedr. Wilh. Fitzenhagen</span> was educated under the
guidance of Grützmacher as a violoncello virtuoso of eminent
rank. This distinguished artist was born on September 15,
1848, in the little town of Seesen, in Brunswick, where his
father was music director. He early began his practice&mdash;in
his fifth year on the piano, in his eighth on the violoncello, in
his eleventh year on the violin. Besides these instruments,
he learned by degrees several wind instruments in order to
take part in his father’s musical entertainments when a
vacancy occurred in his orchestra. By means of this
many-sided capacity, Fitzenhagen gained, even in early
youth, a certain routine in musical matters which, later
on, stood him in good stead.</p>

<p>Fitzenhagen received the first regular cello instruction,
besides making progress in piano and violin playing, from
the Ducal chamber musician, Plock, in Brunswick. But he
soon made his appearance there as soloist. His really
serious study, however, was in the beginning of October of
the year 1862, when he became Theodore Müller’s pupil.
After a lapse of three years, Fitzenhagen was heard by the
Duke of Brunswick in the Theatre Royal. The trial performance
was so satisfactory that the Duke, in order to forward him
in his artistic career, released him entirely from military service.
Patrons of high standing immediately supplied him with the
means of prosecuting his cello studies under Grützmacher.
This occurred in May, 1867. A year later, notwithstanding his
youth, he was named a member of the Hofkapelle of Saxony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
From that time he frequently made his appearance as a solo
player; took part, in 1869, in the general musical gathering
in Leipsic, and in 1870 at the Beethoven Festival. Franz
Liszt wished to gain him for the orchestra at Weimar, but
Fitzenhagen preferred to accept an offer made to him to be
Professor at the Imperial Conservatoire in Moscow. From
that time he has developed an uncommonly active and
successful artistic capability as a concert player as well as
chamber music performer. He gained striking results in his
professorial relations, for he is at present looked upon as the
cello master of greatest repute in Russia. The best of his
pupils will be mentioned in the last section of this book.</p>

<p>After Fitzenhagen had been appointed Concertmaster to the
Russian Imperial Musical Society, the direction of the Moscow
Music and Orchestral Union, which organises annually some
concerts, was made over to him some three years ago.</p>

<p>Fitzenhagen was very industrious as a composer. Besides a
String Quartet, which gained the prize of the St. Petersburg
Chamber Musical Union, he wrote four Cello Concertos, a
Suite for Violoncello and orchestra, a “Fantasia” on <i>Motifs</i>
from Rubinstein’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dämon</span>,” with orchestra; a long list of
drawing-room pieces, amongst them twelve little pieces which
embraced a Quarto, a Ballade with orchestra, and a book
containing technical Cello Studies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert Petersen</span>, born on October 23, 1856, in Lübeck,
after he had studied under Grützmacher, was first cellist in
the private bands at Dresden, Kreuznach, and Cassel;
accepted engagements for America and Pawlowsk, near St.
Petersburg, and has since filled for ten years the position of
solo cellist in Magdeburg, as well as that of cello master at the
Musical Institute there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carl Monhaupt</span>, born on March 9, 1856, in Hamburg,
began his musical studies with piano playing. In his fifteenth
year he decided for the violoncello, of which he learnt the
elements from the cellist named Katerbaum, of the Central
Hall orchestra of his native town. In 1872 he betook himself
to Sondershausen, in order to pursue his studies under the
direction of his brother Fritz,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> who at that time belonged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the Royal orchestra of Sondershausen as first cellist. Here he
remained three years, when he went to Dresden in order to
perfect his education under Grützmacher’s guidance. At the
present time he is first violoncellist of the Musical Society and
of the Orchestral Union at Berne, as well as teacher at the
music school there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar Brückner</span>, born on January 2, 1857, at Erfurt,
received his first cello instruction from the Concertmaster,
Herlitz, in Ballenstedt, after he had been prepared by his
father for the musical career. But he completed the most
important part of his studies under Fr. Grützmacher, in
Dresden, where he also received instruction in the theoretical
portion from Felix Dräseke.</p>

<p>After he had finished his course of study, Brückner
undertook concert tours in Russia, Poland, and Holland.
Wherever he was heard he was marked by well-merited
success. Besides his clever “technique” he made a
great impression by his broad and full tone. From 1882-1884
he was engaged as violoncellist at the Grand Ducal
Court Theatre in Neustrelitz. On retiring from this post he
received the title of Chamber Virtuoso. Since 1886 he has
been solo cellist at the Theatre Royal, Wiesbaden. At the
same time he takes part in the Violoncello teaching at the
Wiesbaden Conservatoire.</p>

<p>Brückner’s official successor in Neustrelitz, <span class="smcap">Otto Köhler</span>,
was born December 21, 1861, at Neuhaldensleben (in the
district of Merseburg). He went to school at Chemnitz
and having performed his military service, he entered the
Regiment of Life Grenadiers at Dresden. He there remained
until 1882, in order to perfect himself, under
Grützmacher, in Violoncello playing, which he had already
pursued by himself. In January, 1883, Köhler was engaged
for the Kapelle of the Duke of Coburg Gotha. He remained
two years at this post, during which he went through a
theoretical course under the direction of the Court Kapellmeister,
Langert. In 1885 he was offered the post of solo
cellist at Neustrelitz. In this position he is at present.</p>

<p>A German-American is also amongst Grützmacher’s pupils.
<span class="smcap">Emil Schenk</span>, born at the beginning of the sixties at
Rochester, North America. In 1879 his father, a native of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Baden, who had settled as music teacher in the above-mentioned
American town, sent him to Dresden to complete
his studies under Grützmacher’s direction. He made rapid
progress, and soon attracted the attention of the Dresden
musical circle to so great a degree that at the end of the
same year he was appointed to the Hofkapelle there. His
engagement, however, was only temporary, for as soon as
Schenk had completed his studies under Grützmacher, he
returned to America. On his frequent public appearances in
New York he has had brilliant success. The well-known
Director of the Philharmonic Concerts, Theod. Thomas, did
not let the favourable opportunity escape of gaining over the
highly gifted young artist as solo cellist for his orchestra.
He attained to ever-increasing appreciation and popularity.
But as Thomas so frequently undertook tours with his
orchestra in the States of the Union, this occupation became
at length too irksome to him; he released himself from the
contract, and from that time, encouraged by the sympathy of
the public, he lives in New York as an independent artist, and
works not only as a concert player, but also as a teacher of
great repute.</p>

<p>Another excellent pupil of Grützmacher is <span class="smcap">Hugo Becker</span>,
son of the famous Violinist who founded the Florentine
Quartet, but who unhappily died in the flower of his age, in
1884. Hugo Becker was born on February 13, 1863, at
Strasburg, in Alsace, and at the beginning of the sixth year
of his life received instruction from his father on the piano
and the violin. When he was nine years old, he heard a
Violoncello played in church, and this made such an impression
on him, that he decided in favour of that instrument.
A pupil of Menter’s, the cellist Kündinger, of Mannheim,
whither Becker’s parents had gone in 1869, undertook his
education. At fifteen he had made such progress, that the
place of second cellist was offered to him in the orchestra of
the Mannheim Court Theatre, which he accepted. At the end
of nine months he gave this up in order to go through a
course under Grützmacher, from whose instruction he
benefited for five months. Having returned home, his father
undertook his further tuition, and used to play to him studies
and concert pieces on the Violin which greatly assisted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
progress in regard to their comprehension and rendering.
The circumstance that he was constantly hearing in the
parental home a great deal of chamber music in the best
manner and himself took part in it, was of great value for
the young man’s musical education. In the year 1880
Jean Becker resolved to undertake concert tours with his son
Hugo and his brother and sister <span class="smcap">Jeanne</span> (a pianist) and Hans
(tenor), during which the young Cello virtuoso, then seventeen
years of age, gained his first laurels. While the Becker
family quartet was performing in London, Hugo Becker had
the opportunity of being brought a good deal in contact with
Piatti, which was not without producing some influence on his
playing. The practices at the De Swert Violoncello Concerts,
under the direction of their founder, also contributed to his
progress.</p>

<p>For two years, from October, 1884, till the autumn of 1886,
Becker filled the office of solo cellist at the Frankfort Opera.
From that time he accepted no other post, in order to leave
his time quite free for concert engagements. Frankfort-on-the-Main
has continued to be his place of residence. We
must mention that he has the title of Grand Ducal Chamber
Virtuoso of Baden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl Lübbe</span>, born on February 11, 1839, in Halberstadt,
began his musical career as a member of the regimental band
at Magdeburg, was appointed to the Grand Ducal Berneburg
orchestra at Ballenstedt, and came to Dessau on the union
of the Anhalt Duchies. As he showed himself very assiduous
the Duke of Dessau granted him the means of perfecting
himself still more under the guidance of Grützmacher.
He gained great dexterity and skill, but was inclined to
the various experiments of a virtuoso, which he carried out
also in his compositions. His cello pieces have not been
published. After Drechsler was pensioned Lübbe became his
successor as first Violoncellist in the Court Chapel at Dessau.
He died in his prime on January 7, 1888.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo Jäger</span> took his place, born on May 17, in Warmbrunn.
He profited by the instruction of Popper and
Grützmacher, became then a member of the Hofcapelle of
the Prince of Hohenzollern, in Löwenberg, and after
relinquishing this was employed in Ems, Altenburg, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Brunswick. Since 1874 he has belonged to the Ducal band
in Dessau.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aurel v. Czerwenka</span>, born on December 31, 1860, at
Karánsebes, in the Hungarian state, Szöreny, was first a
pupil of the Steiermark Musical Union at Gratz. In 1882 he
came to Dresden and frequented the Conservatoire as a
pupil of Grützmacher, under whose direction he afterwards
studied privately. On the completion of his education he
worked for a time as first cellist in the Mannsfeld orchestra
in Dresden, and then he undertook the office of solo cellist at
the Land Theatre, as well as that of teacher at the Steiermark
Musical Union at Gratz. His performances show genuine
artistic talent and training.</p>

<p>Two other pupils of Grützmacher’s must be here mentioned
concerning whom there is very defective information. The
first to be considered is <span class="smcap">Theodor Krumbholz</span>, who unfortunately
died while still young. He was first Violoncellist at the
Stuttgard Court Kapelle, with the title of Royal Wurtemburg
Chamber Virtuoso.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H. Ruhoff</span> became, after he had finished his studies, first
cellist at the Theatre Royal at Pesth, but was obliged to give
up his place on account of a nervous affection, and still lives
as a music master at Zurich, where he teaches chiefly at his
brother’s Musical Institute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. Heyn</span>, born in Dresden, is exclusively a pupil of Grützmacher.
After his training he was first occupied in the
orchestra of German Opera at Rotterdam. He is now
working as first Violoncellist in the Grand Ducal band in
Darmstadt. As regards the Violoncellists, Smith and Rüdinger,
who were likewise Grützmacher’s pupils, information will
be given among the Dutch and Danish cellists. As a third
pupil of Drechsler&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl Schröder</span>, born on December 18, 1848, in Quedlinburg,
must be here noticed with distinction. He had already
made such progress in cello studies at fourteen years of age
that he was able to be received into the Hofkapelle at
Sondershausen. After he had joined his brothers in forming a
string quartet, which was distinguished by his performances, he
accepted, in 1873, the place offered to him as first cellist in
the Brunswick Kapelle. Only a year later, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
consented to go as first representative of his instrument
to Leipsic, and he also superintended at the same time
the cello instruction in the Conservatoire there. From
Leipsic Schröder went, in 1881, as Hof-Capellmeister to
Sondershausen. He worked at this post for five years; he
then undertook the direction of German Opera in Rotterdam.
Thence he went, in 1887, as Hof-Capellmeister to Berlin.
Since the autumn of 1888 he has been occupied as Capellmeister
at the Stadt-Theatre at Hamburg.</p>

<p>Schröder published the following Cello compositions:
Three Concertos (Op. 32, 36, and 55), three concerted
pieces (Op. 38, 51, and 56), an Allegro di Sonatina (Op.
13), Pieces of National Airs (Op. 14), a Song without
Words (Op. 15), and a Nocturne (Op. 42). Besides these
he produced a Violoncello school (Op. 16), a school of
scales and chords (Op. 29), a school of shakes and staccatos
(Op. 39), a practical course for Violoncello playing,
as well as a long series of Etudes and Exercises. The
latter bear the Nos. 22, 25, 35, 40, 44, 45, 46, 48, and 57. He
also edited orchestral and concert studies as well as five
classical pieces.</p>

<p>The same continuity of Violoncello playing as that of the
Dresden school cannot be traced in Vienna because, though
at the beginning of our century several cello masters were
actively working at the same time, a similar connection did
not exist amongst them as in Dresden. But the Austrian
capital had the advantage of a richly endowed musical life
by means of the heroes of instrumental music, which had a
quickening and progressive effect on all branches of executive
art, and specially on Violoncello playing. Although this
influence was not confined to Vienna alone&mdash;since the works
of these highly-gifted men, after their publication, spread over
an ever-widening circle&mdash;still the musical world of Vienna was
the chief gainer thereby.</p>

<p>It was at the source and therefore had the opportunity
of knowing and studying the creations of these master composers
at first hand. We need only recall the Schuppanzigh
Art Society, which practised and produced Beethoven’s
Quartets before they were published. The Violoncello was
represented at the end of last century and the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the present one by Anton Kraft and, later, by Joseph Linke.
For the first Beethoven composed the Cello part of the Triple
Concerto (Op. 56). The Sonatas (Op. 5, 69, and 102) of the
great master may be here mentioned as important works of
Violoncello Literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anton Kraft</span> was born on December 30, 1752, in the little
Bohemian town of Rokitzan. After his school education was
finished he entered the University of Vienna, in order to study
law. There he soon began his musical career, and, as he had
already diligently practised Violoncello playing in his father’s
house, and had acquired remarkable proficiency, he did not find
it difficult to procure a position in the Imperial Hofkapelle.
Joseph Haydn, to whom he was introduced as clever, appointed
him, in 1778, to the orchestra of the Prince Esterhazy. As,
however, this artist-patron died at the end of September,
1790, the band was done away with, and Kraft returned
again to Vienna, where, in the year 1793, by his conjunction
with it, the Schuppanzigh String Quartet was founded, which
used to play every Friday morning in the house of Prince
Lichnowsky. Kraft was himself occupied, however, until
1795, in the band of Prince Grassalkowitz, and later on in
that of the Prince Lobkowitz. He died at Vienna on
August 20, 1820.</p>

<p>Of Kraft’s compositions were published&mdash;six Sonatas for
Violoncello, with Bass (Op. 1 and 2); three concerted Duets
for Violin and Violoncello (Op. 3); a Violoncello Concerto,
with orchestra (Op. 4); two Duets for two Violoncellos (Op. 5
and 6), and a Divertissement with Bass.</p>

<p>Amongst Kraft’s pupils his son, Nicolas, and Birnbach must
be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Henrich August Birnbach</span>, born 1782 at Breslaw, went in
1792 to Berlin, and there learnt Piano and Violoncello
playing. The year 1802 found him at Vienna, where he
enjoyed the instructions of Kraft and was employed in the
opera orchestra. Two years later Count Lubomirski engaged
him for his private band in Galicia. But in 1806 he returned
to Vienna, and in 1812 he accepted an engagement as first
Violoncellist at the Theatre of Pesth. From 1822 to 1824 he
remained at Vienna, occupied himself zealously with the
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Chitarra coll’arco</span>,” invented by a certain Stauffer, wrote a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Concerto for it, and played it in a public assembly. In the
year 1825 he at length received an appointment in the Hofkapelle
at Berlin. He seems to have belonged to it until his
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicolas Kraft</span>, born at Esterhazy, in Hungary, on
December 14, 1778, began his musical practice in his fourth
year, on a large tenor which he possessed, something like a
Violoncello. Two years later he played a solo before the
Prince Esterhazy, which his father had written specially for
him with this object in view. At eight years of age he made
a tour, accompanied by his father, and performed at concerts
favourably in Vienna, Presburg, Dresden, and Berlin. On
his return, the young Kraft sought to fill up the gaps in his
general education, which, until then, had been neglected, and
this took up five years. During the time he only occupied
himself with his instrument as a recreation. In 1796 he
entered with his father into the Lobkowitz band. The
prince, who took a great interest in the youth, and cherished
the wish that he should cultivate still further his art, granted
him the means of going through a course with Louis Duport
at Berlin. This happened in the year 1801. He afterwards
went to Holland, in order to be heard there. Prince Esterhazy
meantime desired his speedy return, so that he could not
pursue farther the journey he had begun. On his way home,
he went to Leipsic, Dresden, and Prague, exciting great
enthusiasm everywhere by his performances.</p>

<p>Nicolas Kraft was engaged in the year 1809 as solo cellist
for the Imperial Opera, but retained also his connection with
Prince Lobkowitz, who offered him a permanent salary, under
the condition that he should never play anywhere without his
permission, except in his Palace. This, however, did not continue,
because the Prince fell into serious money difficulties
from the year 1811, and was no longer free to dispose of his
ruined fortune. But Kraft was indemnified in another manner.
At the Congress of Princes in 1814, he played before an
assemblage of crowned heads in Vienna, and the King of
Wurtemburg experienced such great pleasure at his performances,
that he named him his Chamber Virtuoso. He now
settled at Stuttgard, and thence took a journey, in 1818, to
the Rhine, which he extended as far as Hamburg. Here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
became acquainted with Bernard Romberg, who gave him
every encouragement, and showed it by giving with him two
concerts publicly, when he went to Stuttgard in 1820. In the
year 1824 Kraft wounded the first finger of his right hand, on
account of which, after futile attempts at curing it, he was
obliged to retire. He spent his pension in Stuttgard, where
he died on May 18, 1853. Kraft composed for his instrument
four Concertos, nine Duets (three of which are marked as
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Divertissements</span>”), a Polonaise, a Bolero, a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Scène pastorale</span>,”
a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rondo à la chasse</span>,” and two Fantasias, of which
one is an arrangement of airs from the “Freischütz.” Nicolas
Kraft had a son whose Christian name was <span class="smcap">Friedrich</span>, whom
he likewise educated as a clever cellist. He was born on
February 12, 1807, in Vienna, and belonged to the Stuttgard
band as chamber musician. Nothing further is known of
him.</p>

<p>About the same time as Anton Kraft, Friedrich’s grandfather,
<span class="smcap">Joseph Linke</span>, the violoncellist already mentioned, was
at work in Vienna for some years as a distinguished quartet
player. He was born on June 8, 1783, in the Silesian town of
Trachenberg, received his first instruction from his father,
and after his death pursued his studies under a certain Oswald.
In his twelfth year he went to the Dominicans at Breslaw.
There his teachers in cello playing were Lose and Flemming;
for theory he studied under the organist Hanish. Lose was a
member of the theatre orchestra, and when he relinquished
the post Linke took his place. He remained there, however,
only until 1808, when he went to Vienna. He was engaged
immediately by Schuppanzigh for the house quartet of
Count Rasoumowski, which existed until the year 1816. After
the dissolution of this Society, Linke was attracted to Croatia
by the family of Count Erdödisch. Two years later he again
appeared in Vienna, in order to work at the theatre there
as soloist. Thirteen years later he received an appointment
in the same capacity at the Imperial Grand Opera. His
death took place on March 20, 1837.</p>

<p>Linke’s published cello compositions consist of a Concerto,
three books of Variations, a Polonaise, a “Rondoletto,” and
a “Caprice” on Rossini airs. Whilst the elder Kraft and Linke,
whom Beethoven likewise held in great esteem, represented in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Vienna violoncello playing from a purely artistic point of
view,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Merk</span> did so more especially on the virtuoso
side. This artist, born on January 18, 1795, at Vienna,
who was originally to have been a violinist, and had
already in his younger years made great progress,
had the misfortune to be bitten so severely by a dog that,
even after the wound was healed, he was never able again to
bring his left arm into the requisite position for violin
playing. He therefore took up the Violoncello, on which he
received instruction from Philippe Schindlocker.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Under his
direction, Merk made such rapid progress that already after
the lapse of a year he was engaged as quartet player by a
Hungarian magnate. He remained at this post two years,
when he made a tour through the Austrian dominions in
order to make himself known in a wider circle. In 1816 he
was appointed first Violoncellist to the Grand Opera at
Vienna. Three years later he entered the Imperial Kapelle,
and, in 1821, the Professorship for the Violoncello was entrusted
to him at the Vienna Conservatoire, which institution later
on acquired such importance in regard to instrumental music.
He retained the latter office until 1848. In 1834 the Emperor
named him his chamber virtuoso. Soon after he undertook a
prolonged tour, visited Prague, Dresden, Leipsic, Brunswick,
Hanover, Hamburg, and from the last-mentioned town
went to London. In Vienna, Merk enjoyed great favour.
“He was,” C. Hanslick says, in his “History of Vienna
Concerted Music” (p. 245), “indefatigable as an industrious
concert-giver, and continually encouraged by public sympathy.
He frequently performed at Concerts with Mayseder, whose
compositions he played by preference, and might properly be
called the Mayseder of the Violoncello.... Merk
also performed, as cellist, in Böhm’s quartet productions.
As virtuoso he soon surpassed Linke as well as Friedrich
Wranitzky. The latter, who was a son of the violinist
and Kapellmeister, Anton Wranitzky, held a respectable
position among the Viennese cellists of that period, and,
about his twentieth year, frequently played Duets with his
brother, the violinist, Anton Wranitzky, at concerts.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<p>Merk died in Vienna on July 16, 1852. Of his Violoncello
compositions were published&mdash;one Concerto, one Concertino,
one Adagio and Rondo, one Polonaise, four books of Variations,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vingt Exercices</span>” (Op. 11), and Six Etudes (Op. 20).
Formerly these compositions were much played, but, in course
of time, they have gradually gone out of fashion, like most of
the Cello productions of that period.</p>

<p>Amongst Merk’s numerous pupils, the most remarkable
are&mdash;Böhm, Träg, Marx, and the Dutchman, Franco-Mendez.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl Leopold Böhm</span>, born November 4, 1806, at Vienna,
profited by Merk’s instruction in the Conservatoire there.
He was successively member of the orchestras of Josephstadt
Theatre and of the Vienna Theatre. In September of the
year 1824 he went to Donaueschingen, where he was appointed
musician to the Prince of Fürstenburg. Thence he undertook
a successful concert tour to Switzerland and Germany.
When in August, 1849, he was released from his engagement
in the Donaueschingen Kapelle, he went to Strasburg
and entered the theatre orchestra, and also undertook a
series of concerts at Vichy. At the beginning of 1851 the
amateur Prince of Fürstenburg recalled some of the members
of his former band, in order to organize some chamber
music. Amongst them was Böhm, who now concluded his
artistic career at Donaueschingen. Of his Cello compositions
he published a Concerto, Duets, Fantasias, Variations,
Polonaises, and some smaller pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anton Träg</span>, son of a Viennese composer, Andreas Träg,
was born in 1818, at Schwechat, near Vienna; began his
musical education at six years of age, and went to the
Conservatoire at Vienna as a pupil of Merk’s. On February
28, 1845, he was engaged as teacher of Cello playing for
the Conservatoire at Prague. Ten years later however
he gave up the post and returned to Vienna, where he died
on July 7, 1860. Träg devoted himself by special preference
to classical music. He had abundant opportunity of occupying
himself with it in the Palace at Clam. Of his pupils,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich Röver</span> distinguished himself, who was born May 27,
1827. Röver belongs to the number of those violoncellists
who were at first violinists. As early as eight years of age
he decided in favour of the violoncello. Fétis says of him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
“He was about 1863 the cleverest player of his instrument in
Vienna.” Of his compositions may be cited&mdash;Idyll (Op. 1),
Mazurka (Op. 8), and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sérénade du Savoyard</span>” (Op. 11).
Röver died in 1876.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph M. Marx</span>, born in 1792 at Würzburg, where he also
received his musical education, began his artistic career as
member of the Theatre orchestra at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
whence he went to Vienna, in order to study under Merk.
Later on he worked in the Stuttgard orchestra, until he was
appointed first Violoncellist at Carlsruhe. He finally was
musical director there, and died while working in this
capacity on November 11, 1836. His daughter, Pauline,
made her appearance on the stage as a singer during the
years 1830-40. Concerning <span class="smcap">Franco-Mendez</span>, see the Cello
players of Holland.</p>

<p>To the best Viennese violoncellists about the middle of our
century belongs <span class="smcap">Carl Schlesinger</span>, born on August 19, 1813.
The violin was originally his instrument. After the lapse of
three years he devoted himself to the Violoncello. Who his
master was is unknown. In 1838 he was appointed solo
cellist to the Pesth National Theatre. He gave up this place
in 1846, as the opportunity presented itself of entering the
Imperial Opera orchestra in the same capacity at Vienna.
In 1862 the office of cello teacher at the Conservatoire there
was committed to him. Schlesinger’s most noted pupils are:
Udel, Sulzer, Hummer, and Hegyesi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carl Udel</span>, born on February 6, 1844, at Warasdin, in
Croatia, was early directed to the study of music by his father,
who was Kapellmeister, and went in September, 1859, to the
Conservatoire at Vienna. He next occupied himself there
with violin playing under the guidance of Professor Carl
Heissler. Twelve months after he took up the Violoncello, and
for five years received instruction from Schlesinger. In 1867
he was first Cellist at the opera in Pesth; a year later, however,
he returned to Vienna and was engaged there, in 1869,
for the orchestra of the new opera house. By degrees he rose
in his profession, and in May, 1876, he entered the Conservatoire
as substitute for Röver, whose duties were then
performed by Hilpert for a year. After the resignation of the
former, Udel was again elected in his place. In 1878 Cello<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
instruction at the Conservatoire was divided between him and
Hummer, who in the interval had been nominated first Cello
player of the Imperial Hofkapelle. Hummer received the
three upper and Udel the three lower classes. After three
years of work the latter obtained the title of Professor. On
account of an injured hand, Udel was obliged to give up his
place as member of the opera house, since when he has not
played in public. He now devotes himself entirely to
teaching.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Sulzer</span>, born on February 11, 1850, at Vienna,
emerged in 1869 from the Conservatoire as one of Schlesinger’s
best pupils, and was engaged for the Italian Opera, and
as master for the Conservatoire at Bucharest. He remained
there four years. In 1875 Sulzer received an appointment
in the Vienna Opera orchestra. Illness, brought on by over-exertion,
compelled him for three years to withdraw from
his employment in the orchestra. On his recovery he still
further endeavoured to perfect himself, in which the friendly
advice of Popper was of service to him, and in 1880 he was
appointed solo player at the Imperial Opera. At the same time
he gave concerts and taught. He belonged to the Helmsberg
Quartet from 1882 to 1885. Sulzer published various compositions
and productions for the Violoncello at Breitkopf &amp;
Härtel’s, and D. Rahter’s, and Cranz’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reinhold Hummer</span>, born on October 7, 1855, at Linz, on the
Danube, began his career with violin playing very early at
Vienna, where he was brought up, and pursued it with great
eagerness for six years. Then an ardent desire was awakened
in him to learn the Violoncello. He forthwith began the
study of that instrument at the Vienna Conservatoire under
Schlesinger’s guidance. At his death, H. Röver became his
master. On the whole he was four years at the Conservatoire.
His progress was so rapid that he carried off the first prize
against his fellow students by unanimous consent. After he
had left the establishment to which he was indebted for his
education, he immediately received an appointment in the
opera orchestra to which he has belonged since the year
1873. Four years later he was appointed teacher at the
Conservatoire, and in 1878 solo Cellist in the Imperial
Court band; he was also given the title of Professor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Besides his official employments, this much-favoured artist
worked at Vienna and elsewhere as concert and quartet
player.</p>

<p>Hegyesi will be mentioned among the Hungarian violoncellists.</p>

<p>As an older pupil of the Vienna Conservatoire (1835
to 1839), <span class="smcap">Joseph Huber</span> must be mentioned, who was
born about 1816 at Vienna. According to Fétis, he was
heard during the years 1836 and 1837 at the Conservatoire
Concerts. Several of his Violoncello compositions appeared
at Vienna.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A succession of excellent German cellists emanated from the
Prague Conservatoire, opened in the year 1811. At this
Institution <span class="smcap">Johann Nepomuk Hüttner</span>, born on January 1, 1793,
was actively engaged as Violoncello teacher from 1822. He
pursued his studies under J. Zimmermann. After they were
concluded Hüttner joined the orchestra at the Pesth Theatre.
Two years later he went to Lemberg. Thence he undertook,
in 1820, a concert tour in Poland and Russia, after which
he was appointed to the Prague Conservatoire, and the place
of first cellist was immediately given to him at the theatre.
His playing was distinguished by remarkable skill and delicate
tone. In the <i>Adagio</i> his rendering was full of feeling. Hüttner
was specially appreciated as a quartet player.</p>

<p>Hüttner formed an excellent cellist in his pupil, <span class="smcap">Franz
Hegenbarth</span>, born on May 10, 1818, at Gersdorf, in Bohemia.
On May 1, 1831, he entered the Prague Conservatoire, and
remained there as student until May 16, 1837. Count Kinsky
provided him with the means for his artistic education. In
May, 1865, the Professorship at the Prague Conservatoire was
given to Hegenbarth; it had until then been in the hands of
Moritz Wagner, Goltermann’s successor. He devoted himself
to this until his death, which occurred on December 20, 1887.</p>

<p>Besides several other compositions, Hegenbarth wrote a
Violoncello school, though nothing at all of his has been
published. Amongst his pupils the following are distinguished:
Lang, Grünfeld, and Wihan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anton Lang</span>, born on November 10, 1850, at Carlsbad, from
his tenth year played both the Piano and Violin, but decided
at thirteen in favour of the Violoncello. In 1865 he became
Hegenbarth’s pupil in the Prague Conservatoire. When his
training was ended Lang was employed as solo player in
several concert orchestras. Since 1877 he has been attached
to the Grand Ducal Kapelle in Schwerin as first cellist, with
the title of “Kammer Virtuoso.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich Grünfeld</span>, born on April 21, 1855, at Prague,
went to the Conservatoire there, and profited by the instructions
of Hegenbarth. In 1873 he became solo cellist at the comic
opera at Vienna and filled this place for two years. In
1876 he went to Berlin, where he worked as teacher of
his instrument. From time to time he undertook some
successful concert tours in Germany, Russia, and Austria,
with his brother Alfred. Everywhere his beautiful tone and
his tasteful rendering were appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans Wihan</span>, born on June 5, 1855, at Politz, in Bohemia,
is likewise a pupil of the Prague Conservatoire, which he
frequented from 1868 until 1873. At the end of this period he
studied for awhile under the direction of Davidoff. His
excellent performances procured for him the position of first
Violoncellist in the Hofkapelle at Munich, which he filled for
eight years with honour. In the spring of 1888 he was
nominated to the Professorship of the Prague Conservatoire
as successor to his master, Hegenbarth.</p>

<p>Another of Hüttner’s pupils, <span class="smcap">Selmar Bagge</span>, must be cited,
born on June 30, 1823, at Coburg.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> He received his musical
education from the year 1837 at the Prague Conservatoire,
and after he had pursued a course of composition under
Simon Sechter, became a teacher of the theory at the Vienna
Conservatoire. He relinquished this post in the year 1855,
and from that time was chiefly engaged in composition, until
in 1868 he was summoned to Basle as Director of the music
school.</p>

<p>Amongst Hüttner’s pupils there is also a gifted dilettante,
Joseph Edler von Portheim, born on January 6, 1817, at
Prague. For many years he has deserved the thanks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
musical world in his native town by his zealous encouragement
of chamber music, not only in his hospitable house,
frequented by native and foreign artists, but also abroad.
Since the foundation of the Prague Chamber Music Society
(1876), he has been at the head of the undertaking, to which
he devotes his indefatigable care.</p>

<p>Three other pupils of the Prague Conservatoire must be
noticed in this place. <span class="smcap">Ebert</span>, <span class="smcap">Cabisius</span>, and <span class="smcap">Popper</span>. They
all had the benefit of Joh. August Jul. Goltermann’s<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
instruction, who from 1850-1862, as successor to Träg, was
teacher at the above-named establishment. (See page <a href="#Page_123">123</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludwig Ebert</span>, born on April 13, 1834, at Schloss Kladrau,
in Bohemia, began early his musical training in the home of
his father, who was royal treasurer of Windischgratz, and
was sent in 1846 to Prague in order to study at the
Conservatoire.</p>

<p>At first he received instruction from Träg. But when he
went to Vienna, Ebert studied two years more under
Goltermann’s direction. From the autumn of 1852 until
Easter, 1854, he was cellist at the opera in Temesvar, and
was then engaged as first performer of his instrument for the
Oldenburg Hofkapelle, where he worked up to the year
1874. Invested with the title of Concertmaster by the
Grand Duke, as a mark of distinction, Ebert, in the same
year, accepted the offer of being first cellist of the Gürzenich
orchestra in Cologne, and teacher at the Conservatoire of the
Rhenish metropolis. In this place he remained until April 1,
1888. At present Ebert is living at Wiesbaden, where he
devotes himself to teaching. He has published “Four pieces”
for Violoncello and Piano in the form of a Sonata (Op. 3), and
three “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Charakterstücke</span>” (Op. 7).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julius Cabisius</span>, born October 15, 1841, at Halle-on-the-Saal,
received his first instruction from his father. During
the years 1855-1861, he studied under Goltermann at the
Prague Conservatoire. He then became a member of the
Court Kapelle at Löwenberg and Meiningen. From the latter
place he was summoned, in 1877, to be first Cellist in the
royal band at Stuttgard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">David Popper</span>, born on June 18, 1845 or 1846, in Prague,
soon gained for himself, after leaving the Conservatoire of his
native town, a remarkable reputation during the concert tours,
which he began in the year 1863 as an excellent and cultivated
solo player. He received special honour, in 1865, at the
Carlsruhe Musical Festival, and in 1867, in Vienna, where,
from 1868, he was engaged as first cellist at the Imperial Opera.
In 1873 he gave up this post, in order to undertake, in company
with his wife, the famous pianist, Sophie Menter, some
concert tours, which led him into Germany, France, England,
and Russia. He is at present teacher at the Pesth Conservatoire.
Popper’s playing is distinguished by its very pure and
extremely clever technique, as well as by a refined, graceful
manner of rendering. He published for the Violoncello two
Concertos (Op. 8 and 24), two Suites (Op. 16 and 50), as well
as a considerable number of smaller drawing-room pieces,
which are in much favour among cellists.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Berlin, as we saw, a great influence was exercised by
France through the brothers Duport,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> but in consequence of
the political events of the years 1806-1807, which were the
cause of so much suffering in Prussia, it was almost paralysed,
for Louis Duport returned to France on the outbreak of the
war declared by Napoleon Buonaparte; and his elder brother,
who on account of his advanced age could no longer occupy
himself with Violoncello playing, went at the same time into
retirement. It is, however, possible and even probable that
the Violoncellist,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Friedrich Kelz</span>, born on April 11, 1786, at
Berlin, if he did not actually take regular lessons from him,
was able to profit by his occasional advice.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>His first years of study were spent by Kelz chiefly with
the town musician, Fuchs, under whose direction he occupied
himself with well-nigh every kind of musical instrument,
amongst which the Violoncello attracted him most. His uncle,
Ad. Friedrich Milke, who was himself not a bad cellist,
assisted his progress on that instrument. He also provided
for his reception into the band of Prince Frederick August of
Brunswick-Öls, to which he belonged, from the year 1801, for
four years. When this prince died, in 1805, Kelz returned to
Berlin, and was nominated, in 1811, Royal Chamber Musician.
In 1857 he went into retirement, and died in January, 1862.
He must have been much in request as teacher of his instrument.
His compositions, the number of which it is pretended
extend to about three hundred, are of a very superficial
description, and have long fallen into oblivion.</p>

<p>More remarkable than Kelz in Violoncello playing was <span class="smcap">Moritz
Ganz</span>, who was born at Mayence in the year 1804, and
learnt the elements of music from his father. In Violoncello
playing he made further progress under the Bohemian
Cellist, Stiastny, who at that time was residing at
Frankfort-on-the-Maine. Ganz then joined the orchestra
at Mayence until, in 1826, he was appointed first
Violoncellist in the Berlin Kapelle. During this engagement
he undertook, in the years 1833-1837, concert tours
to Paris and London. In appreciation of his performances
he received from the King of Prussia the title of Concertmaster.
His playing, which gave proof of solid cultivation,
was artistic and in every respect made an advantageous
impression, without, however, electrifying. His compositions
are unpretending, and consist of Concertos, Duets, and
Variations.</p>

<p>Among the pupils educated by Ganz the most remarkable
are&mdash;Rietz, Lotze, Giese, and Klietz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julius Rietz</span>, born on December 28, 1812, at Berlin, had,
besides Ganz, also Bernhard Romberg for a short time as
master, and developed so rapidly that, as early as sixteen
years of age, he was received into the orchestra of the Royal
Stadt-Theatre of his native town.</p>

<p>Six years later he went to Düsseldorf, and worked as
assistant-director at the theatre managed by Immermann,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
with Mendelssohn at its head; when the latter retired he
undertook the sole conduct of the opera, and became also, when
Mendelssohn was summoned to Leipsic, town Music Director.
He filled this place until 1847, in which year he went to settle
at Leipsic, in order to work as “Capellmeister” at the theatre.
His work so greatly increased at Leipsic&mdash;for he not
only undertook the direction of the Academy of Singing,
but also, in 1848, the conducting of the Gewandhaus
Concerts&mdash;that he was obliged more and more to neglect cello
playing. In Dresden, whither Rietz went in 1860 as Court
Kapellmeister, he almost entirely discontinued performing.
In private circles only he now and then caused his instrument
to be heard, as his time was wholly taken up by his official
occupations, as well as by the direction of the Dresden
Conservatoire, which was given over to him, and by the
editorial labours connected with the publication of the collected
works of the great classical composers, set on foot by Breitkopf
and Härtel. In the midst of this varied artistic activity
he died on September 17, 1877.</p>

<p>Rietz’s Violoncello playing was of an able but simply
deserving kind and was limited entirely to the more classical
sphere of music. His compositions consist of two Concertos
and a Fantasia with orchestral accompaniment. He
produced the latter on February 15, 1844, in the Gewandhaus,
at Leipsic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wilhelm Lotze</span>, born on January 17, 1817, at Berlin,
acquired the first elements of cello playing under the royal
chamber musician, Töpfer (1865), and then Ganz was his
master. In 1837 he received an appointment in the Royal
Kapelle of his native town, and from 1838-1852 belonged to
the excellent Zimmermann String Quartet. Lotze was
pensioned in 1872.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Giese</span>, born on November 24, 1821, at Coblenz on
the Rhine, undertook concert journeys through France and
Switzerland after he had for some time profited by the
instruction of Ganz; he then went to the Hague, where he
became teacher at the Royal School of Music and first
Violoncellist at the French Theatre. He educated a large
number of pupils. Amongst them we shall mention only
his son,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz Giese</span>, who was born on January 2, 1859, at the
Hague. At ten years of age he was so forward that he was
able publicly to perform Romberg’s second Concerto. He
completed his studies under Grützmacher in Dresden and
under Jacquard in Paris. After he had made a journey
through Sweden and Denmark, he was for a year soloist in
the Amsterdam Park orchestra, and then entered, as a
member, into the Mendelssohn Quintet Club of Boston. As
one of the chief supporters he took part for a long time in
the annual concert journeys of the Society, which extended to
North America and Australia. At present he is living as a
soloist at Boston.</p>

<p>The fourth of the above-mentioned pupils of Ganz, <span class="smcap">Magnus
Klietz</span>, born on April 29, 1828, at Altenkirchen, on the Island
of Rügen, began his musical career at fourteen as a pupil of
the Greifswalder town music director, Abel. After a
year’s instruction on the violin and various wood-wind
instruments, he decided on learning the Violoncello, which he
chose as his principal instrument. In 1848 he went to
Berlin to the Concertmaster Ganz, pursued his studies under
him for a year, and then selected Hamburg as his settled
place of residence. In 1850 he was appointed first cellist at
the Stadt-Theatre as successor to Joh. Aug. Jul. Goltermann.
In this position he remained seventeen years, giving lessons
as well. He then joined the Philharmonic orchestra and
was one of the founders of the Quartet Union now existing
in Hamburg.</p>

<p>After him, as a remarkable Berlin violoncellist, must
be mentioned <span class="smcap">Julius Stahlknecht</span>, born on March 17,
1817, in Posen. Both Drews and Wranitzki were his
masters. Their method of instruction must have been
good, for as early as twenty-one years of age (1838)
Stahlknecht was so far educated that he was admitted into
the Berlin Hofkapelle. He undertook later, in company
with his brother Adolf, who was a respectable violin player,
a concert tour; and with him and the addition of the pianist
Carl Albert Löschhorn, from 1844 or 1846, he gave for some
years, Trio Soirées, which were very popular with the
Berlin public. After the death of Ganz he stepped into his
place with the title of “Concertmeister.” In 1881 he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
pensioned. He had as his successor the Cello virtuoso,
Louis Lübeck. Of Cello compositions he published two
Concertos and several smaller pieces besides&mdash;as, for example,
Divertissements (Op. 3), a Fantasia (Op. 6), Three Pieces
with Piano (Op. 8) and a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Serénade Espagnole</span>” (Op. 11).</p>

<p>Stahlknecht formed an excellent cellist in <span class="smcap">Albert Rüdel</span>,
who was born on February 29, 1840, at Wittstock in
East Priegnitz, where his father was musical Director. During
the years 1859-1867 he pursued his studies at Berlin, under
Stahlknecht. On June 1, 1867, he was appointed Royal
Chamber Musician, and in the year 1880 solo Cellist of the
Hofkapelle. Rüdel often had the honour from that time of
being admitted to take part in the Royal Concerts. Kaiser
William I. liked his playing, and repeatedly expressed to him
his approbation. Amongst Rüdel’s compositions for the
Violoncello must be mentioned: Romance (B major), Elegie
(D minor), Introduction, Andante e Tempo di Valse, four
Fantasias for Concert-room, and many little Drawing-room
pieces for pupils. All these productions have a piano accompaniment.</p>

<p>Violoncello playing received a fresh impulse in Berlin by
the opening, under the direction of Joachim, of a section of
the Royal High School, on October 1, 1869, for executive
music. The Belgian cellist, <span class="smcap">Jules de Swert</span>, was one of the
first to give the necessary instruction at the above-named
Institute. <span class="smcap">Wilhelm Müller</span> succeeded him from 1873-1876
in this office. Both masters were, however, at the establishment
too short a time to pave the way for any important
results. These were first attained by means of Hausmann’s
appointment, who since the year 1876 has been working as
teacher of Violoncello playing at the Berlin High School.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Hausmann</span>, born on August 23, 1852, at Rottleberode,
in the Harz, frequented the Gymnasium at Brunswick,
and benefited there, from 1861-1867, by the Violoncello
instruction of Theodor Müller, who advanced him considerably.
He was then <i>Elève</i> of the Berlin High School for Music, and
there prosecuted his studies for three years, under the direction
of Wilhelm Müller, nephew of the Brunswick master just
mentioned. Finally, he went to Piatti, and under him
pursued a course in London, and later on at his property at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Caddenabia, on Lake Como. Shortly after Hausmann took
an engagement with Count Hochberg, in Silesia, as Cellist of
the string quartet formed by him, and after this was dissolved,
in 1876, he was named second master of Cello playing at the
Berlin High School for Music; three years later he rose to
the position of regular teacher, and from that time he fulfilled
the duties alone in his own department. In 1884 he received
the title of Professor in acknowledgment of his deserving work.</p>

<p>Hausmann at the present time belongs to the most eminent
masters of his instrument. He is not only a distinguished
solo player, but also an excellent quartet player,
which is evident from the fact that Joachim has chosen him
as his usual quartet associate. Of the pupils formed by
Hausmann, until now the following have specially distinguished
themselves: Roth, Dechert, Prill, Koch, and
Lüdemann.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philipp Roth</span>, born on October 25, 1853, at Tarnowitz, in
Upper Silesia, occupied himself in his father’s house from his
eighth to his twelfth year with violin playing, and then went
over to the Violoncello. After he had for some time applied
himself to quartet playing with his brothers, he became the
pupil of Wilhelm Müller, and later on of Robert Hausmann,
at the Berlin High School for Music. He soon took part in
the lessons, conducted by Joachim, in quartet and orchestra
playing, and also pursued the study of composition under
Wilh. Taubert and Woldemar Bargiel. Settled in Berlin for
eighteen years, he only left the capital in order to make
concert tours, of which he undertook one three years ago into
Russia. He, however, has devoted his powers chiefly to
teaching. Roth has also been zealous in the publication of
Cello literature. Besides his original compositions, he has
published a long list of various kinds of attractive music
pieces as arrangements for Violoncello and Piano, as well as
a Violoncello school and a “Guide to Violoncello Literature,”
which latter has also been published separately.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> This list,
which ought to be recommended, will, it is hoped, be continued
and completed in later editions without delay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hugo Dechert</span>, born September 16, 1860, in Potschappel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
near Dresden, received from his father, who is a musician,
instructions in violin playing at six years of age, and from
his twelfth year in Cello playing. Until 1875 he profited by
the instruction of the chamber musician, Heinrich Tietz, in
Dresden. Then began Dechert’s practical work. At first he
was for a year first Cellist in the orchestra of the Belvedere,
on the Brühl Terrace, at Dresden, and then, after some
concert tours in Saxony and Silesia, he was engaged at a
Concert Orchestra in Warsaw. In 1887 he went to Berlin.
There he had the good fortune, by the acquisition of a
scholarship as well as by getting free instruction in the High
School for Music, to pursue and complete his studies under
the direction of Rob. Hausmann. Since 1881 he has belonged
to the Royal Kapelle at Berlin, and he is also occupied as a
much-appreciated concert and quartet player as well as
teacher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul Prill</span>, born October 1, 1860, at Berlin, received
from his father, a royal Prussian military bandmaster, his
first lessons both in piano and violin playing. Later on the
musical director, W. Handwerg, undertook his instruction on
the piano, and the chamber musician, W. Sturm, the theoretical
part. At the same time Paul Prill occupied himself in
learning the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cornet à piston</span>” with his father. Only in his
seventeenth year, after he had been performing at concerts
with his brother and sister under the conduct of his father in
Germany, was fulfilled his cherished wish to devote himself
to Violoncello playing. In this the chamber musician,
Mahnecke, assisted him by giving him gratuitous instruction.
After a lapse of nine months he had made such rapid progress
on the Violoncello that, having undergone a previous examination,
he was received as a free pupil into the High School
for Music. He frequented it for four years, and then entered
the so-called master class, conducted by Bargiel, in order to
perfect himself in the theoretical department; but at the same
time he also benefited further by Hausmann’s tuition.
He soon found an appointment as solo cellist in the
Berlin Symphony Kapelle, as well as in the orchestra of the
Italian Opera. From the beginning of September, 1882,
until the end of April, 1885, he worked as solo cellist in
the “Bilse Orchestra.” Such occupation did not suit him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
for a continuance; he aimed higher, and desired to devote
himself to the conducting branch of music. After Bilse had
dissolved his orchestra, he found an engagement as Director
at the Belle Alliance Theatre, in Berlin. Occasionally
also he performed the office of Conductor at the Wallner
Theatre. This work, however, did not have the hoped-for result,
as there seemed no prospect of a more remunerative sphere
of conducting. Paul Prill then determined to accept the
place of solo cellist at the German Opera at Rotterdam. With
this the advantageous offer was made to him of performing at
concerts in and around Rotterdam, yet he did not lose
sight of his ambition in regard to the career of Conductor.
His wish was fulfilled, for during some time he has been
second Kapellmeister of the Rotterdam Opera.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedrich Koch</span>, descended from a well-known Berlin family
of painters, was born on July 3, 1862, and began his musical
studies in his eleventh, but Violoncello playing only in his fourteenth
year. From 1879-1882 he was pupil of the Royal High
School of Music, and specially under Hausmann, as well as
Succo and Bargiel for theory and composition. In the summer
of 1883 he was named Royal Chamber Musician, after he
had been submitted to a trial performance. In 1886 he
founded, with three of his colleagues, a string quartet, which
within a short period has gained a respected position in the
Berlin musical world. Of Koch’s Cello compositions only two,
Op. 1 and 2, up to the present time have appeared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Otto Lüdemann</span>, born on September 7, 1864, at Bernkastel,
on the Mosel, after his father had prepared him, was from 1876-1880
Ebert’s pupil in the Cologne Conservatoire, to whom he
is indebted for part of his other artistic education. At the beginning
of 1880 he went to the Berlin High School of Music, and
benefited by Hausmann’s instruction, not only in compulsory
piano playing but in the theory of music until 1883. In this
year he took part in the playing competition for the possession
of a vacant cello place in the Royal Prussian Kapelle, in which
he succeeded so well that in the autumn of the year 1884 he
was nominated Royal Chamber Musician. Besides his official
duty he was selected by his master, Hausmann, to be his
assistant in the High School of Music, and also commissioned
to prepare his advanced Cello pupils for the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
classes&mdash;a proof of how highly his performances were appreciated.
Amongst others belonging to the older and more
modern of Berlin violoncellists are Griebel and Espenhahn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julius Griebel</span>, born on October 25, 1809, at Berlin, learnt
cello playing of his father, who was bassoon player in the
Hofkapelle there. As Max Bohrer belonged to it, he also
received instruction from him. At the beginning of the year
1827 Griebel was taken into the orchestra and rose to be
solo cellist next to Ganz. During the years 1835-1841 he
undertook successful journeys to Holland, and later on he
visited also Denmark. As chamber music player he found
opportunity of distinguishing himself in the Zimmermann
Quartet, of which he had been permanent cellist for many
years since 1835. He died in 1865.</p>

<p>His pupil, <span class="smcap">Hermann Jacobowsky</span>, born on October 19,
1846, in Neustrelitz, received instruction in piano playing
during his school years from his father, who was clarinetist
of the Mecklenburg-Strelitz Court band. At sixteen years
of age he decided for the musical profession, chose the
Violoncello as his instrument, and went to Berlin in order
to take lessons from Griebel; at the same time Rich.
Wuerst was his master in theory. In 1864 Jacobowsky
entered as solo cellist into the Liebig “Symphonie Kapelle.”
Six years later he was summoned to Jassy as teacher of
cello playing at the music school, but when the Franco-German
War broke out he had to hasten to the standard,
and took part in the campaign. When it was over, he
received a place as Chamber Musician in the Royal orchestra,
which had already been promised to him in 1868, consequent
on a successful competition.</p>

<p>Jacobowsky has not only made himself known to advantage
as solo player, but also in connection with the
Soirées in which he takes part with Hans Bishoff and Waldemar
Meyer. Besides some Drawing-room Pieces for Violoncello,
he published “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tonleiterübungen in fünf Stufen</span>” and twenty-two
Elementary Exercises in the first position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L. Espenhahn</span>, born at Sandersleben, was at first member
of the Dessau Court band, but entered as assistant into the
Prussian Hofkapelle, after he had appeared in Berlin as a
solo player. He did not, however, remain in this place, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
accepted an invitation to join the private band of the Russian
Prince Narischkin. After the death of the latter, he was
again received into the Berlin Kapelle. Since 1852 he has
belonged to the Zimmermann String Quartet, as successor to
Griebel. He was also occupied as teacher in Berlin.
Espenhahn died in the year 1879.</p>

<p>For Munich during the first quarter of our century the chief
representative of Violoncello playing was <span class="smcap">Philipp Moralt</span>.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
He belonged to a gifted Bavarian musical family, whose
members were employed in the Munich Court Kapelle. This
family possessed in <span class="smcap">Joseph Moralt</span> a second younger Cellist.
Nothing further is known about him except the fact of his
performing so well that he was admitted into the Leipsic
Gewandhaus Concert on January 21, 1847, for solo playing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Menter</span>, however, who received his education from
the elder of the two Moralts just named, had a greater artistic
importance. Born on January 17, 1808, in the Bavarian
village of Daudenkofen, near Landshut, he began as so many
of his colleagues did, with the violin, but soon abandoned it
to take up the Violoncello. He had scarcely completed his
twenty-first year before he found a position in the Hohenzollern-Hechingen
band. In 1833 his vocation took him to
Munich. He belonged to the Kapelle there until his death,
which occurred on April 18, 1856. Menter&mdash;he is the father
of the well-known Piano virtuosa of that name&mdash;made himself
known outside his sphere of work by concert tours in
Germany, Austria, Holland, Belgium, and England, as well
as by several Cello compositions, of which a few were
published after his decease.</p>

<p>Menter formed several good Cellists, amongst them the
best is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hippolyte Müller</span>. He was born on May 16, 1834, at
Hilburghausen, and received his first instruction from his
father. His development was so rapid that, at eleven years
of age, he already appeared as soloist. He was assigned to
Menter for further cultivation, by whose assistance he became
a master of his art. In 1854 Müller joined the Munich Court
Band as first Cellist. He also undertook the tuition at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Conservatoire. On August 23, 1876, he died at Munich.
His pupil,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gebhard Graf</span>, for fourteen years first Violoncellist in the
Grand Ducal Kapelle at Brunswick, was born on February 4,
1843, at Waal, near Buchloe, in Bavaria, and attended, from
his fifteenth year, the Royal Conservatoire at Munich. He was
dismissed from it at the end of four years with a certificate
of merit, and then held concerts in Hamburg, Warsaw,
Amsterdam, Frankfort, and Munich. Later, he was six years as
solo Cellist in the Princes’ Kapelle at Sondershausen, worked
with the Bilse Orchestra for one year as first Cellist, and
after that time had elapsed he took an engagement in the
Grand Ducal Kapelle at Strelitz. Thence he was summoned
to Brunswick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ferdinand Büchler</span> is also an excellent pupil of Menter’s,
born on March 17, 1817, at Darmstadt, where his father was
Grand Ducal chamber musician. As his first instructor
he had the Darmstadt Concertmaster, <span class="smcap">August Daniel
Mangold</span>, born in July, 1775, at Darmstadt. He was a very
distinguished artist on his instrument, of the Romberg school,
and belonged to the Darmstadt orchestra from 1814 until his
death, which happened in 1842. Büchler got on well under
Mangold’s training, but went, in order to perfect himself, to
Jos. Menter, whom he had met during the winter of 1838-1839,
at the Munich Quartet Soirées, when he had undertaken
a concert tour to Vienna. Having returned to Darmstadt
he again found an appointment in the band there to which
he had belonged previous to his absence in Munich, and was
named first Cellist. An injured arm, which was never entirely
cured, compelled Büchler to withdraw from playing in public
as a soloist, though he still continued as a chamber music
player. In 1881, after forty-six years’ service, he was
pensioned.</p>

<p>Büchler pursued his theoretical studies under the guidance
of the Darmstadt Cantor, Rinck. They enabled him to compose
a few cello pieces which may be favourably distinguished
from amongst others. This is especially the case with regard
to his five Studies; they are of value particularly for the
purposes of teaching, and consequently are admitted into
many music schools. Besides these, he wrote two pieces for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
four Violoncellos, and transcribed also three pieces from
Alessandro Stradella’s Cantatas. At present there are now
in the press arrangements of twenty-five pieces of ancient
and modern masters with the title “Bunte Reihe.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Valentin Müller</span>, born on February 14, 1830, at Münster,
in Westphalia, studied with Menter, and continued under
Servais, in Brussels, in 1848. During his many years’
residence in the Belgian capital, he performed for some time
the functions of Deputy-Professor at the Conservatoire.
In 1858 he betook himself to Paris and filled the place
of Chevillard<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> in the Maurin Quartet. Ten years later
he accepted a post at Frankfort-on-the-Maine, where he
worked as member of the Quartet of the Museum Society,
and as master at the Hoch Conservatoire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Werner</span>, born on June 25, 1837, at Würzburg, was,
in 1852, <i>Elève</i> of the Munich Conservatoire, and educated
himself there as Violoncellist under Menter’s direction. In
the year 1867 he went to Dresden to Fr. Grützmacher in order
to become better acquainted with his method of instruction.
After he had been solo cellist in the Court Kapelle at
Munich, he became teacher at the music school, and later
on he received the title of Royal Chamber Musician and
Professor, which proves that he was particularly esteemed
in the music world of Munich.</p>

<p>In compositions Werner published a Quartet for four
Violoncellos, Studies, Etudes, Caprices, Solos, a book of Songs,
as well as an instruction book, with Piano accompaniment,
under the title of “Practical Violoncello School.” With regard
to this the Munich <cite>Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>, of September 12, 1886,
remarks: “Concerning this School, which is entirely devoid of
theory&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, thoroughly practical&mdash;there exist a whole list of
witnesses from celebrated authorities of that branch of Art, such
as C. Davidoff, in St. Petersburg, Jos. Rheinberger, Louis Abel,
and so forth, as well as many recommendations (from the
Bavarian Ministry of Instruction) and acknowledgments in the
musical periodicals of the time on the subject. All are
unanimous that the above-named work must be considered
in every way the best instruction book amongst those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
highest rank.” The Cello School of Werner has gone through
five editions already since its appearance.</p>

<p>Amongst Werner’s numberless pupils we can only here cite
<span class="smcap">Heinrich Schübel</span>, at Carlsruhe; <span class="smcap">H. Schönchen</span>, in Munich;
<span class="smcap">Emil Herbeck</span>, at St. Petersburg; <span class="smcap">Frl. Marie Geist</span> and <span class="smcap">Carl
Ebner</span>, in Munich. The last-named artist, born on November 6,
1857, in Deggendorf, near Munich, is Royal Bavarian Chamber
Musician, and takes part in the Trio Soirées, which are held
annually with the co-operation of Bussmayer and Walter, in
Munich. His Violoncello compositions, published as Op. 5,
6, 8, 9, 10, and 14, belong to the Salon <i>genre</i>.</p>

<p>Meiningen possessed a very distinguished Violoncellist in
<span class="smcap">Gustave Knoop</span>, who was born at Göttingen in 1805, and
was member of the Meiningen Court orchestra. He must have
been, in regard to beauty of tone, a successful rival of Romberg.
It is related of him that he only married in order to get into
his possession a valuable Violoncello which belonged to his
wife; that soon after the wedding he set out on a journey with
the instrument, and did not return home again. It is a fact
that Knoop went to North America in 1843, and on December
25, 1849, he ended his life at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Of Knoop’s pupils two are worth mentioning: Grabau and
Mollenhauer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johan Andreas Grabau</span>, born October 19, 1809, had, after
benefiting by Knoop’s instruction, Fr. Kummer as his master
for a time. He chose Leipsic as his settled residence, but
only worked at his vocation until his marriage, which made
it possible for him to pursue music for his pleasure only. He
remained, however, until his death, which occurred in
August, 1886, a member of the Gewandhaus Orchestra.
Grabau was less occupied with solo than with quartet playing,
in which he was a much esteemed performer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich Mollenhauer</span>, born on September 10, 1825, at
Erfurt, was from his fourth year taught piano and violin
playing, and when only a half-grown boy he made, with his
brothers, under his father’s guidance, a concert tour through
Germany. He later devoted himself, under Knoop’s direction,
to Violoncello playing with great success. Mollenhauer
belonged for three years, from 1853, to the Royal band at
Stockholm, and then turned to New York. After he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
travelled through the North American States as a Concert-giver,
he settled down, in 1867, at Brooklyn, and founded
there a music school.</p>

<p>In the sphere of chamber music the best performer
was the Cellist of the formerly famous <span class="smcap">Müller String
Quartet</span>, whose name was <span class="smcap">Theodore</span>. He was born on
September 27, 1802, in Brunswick, and died there on
May 22, 1875. He is described as the very soul of the Quartet
Band, which with his brothers Carl (1st Violin), Georg
(2nd Violin), and Gustave (Tenor), he so carefully kept together
for so many years, the most brilliant period of which was from
1831-1855. During this time the brothers Müller undertook
journeys into Germany, Holland, Denmark, and Russia, which
were crowned with fame. They were also heard in Paris.</p>

<p>As is known, the Müller String Quartet was continued by
the sons of Charles, the eldest of the brothers, who
belonged as Concert Master to the Ducal Kapelle of Brunswick.
The Violoncellist of the junior Quartet Band was&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Müller</span>, born on June 1, 1834, in Brunswick. He
had his uncle, Theodore, as his master. After he had been
working with his brothers in the Meiningen orchestra, as well
as in Wiesbaden and Rostock, he entered the Berlin Court
Kapelle as solo cellist, and also undertook the Cello instruction
in the Royal High School for Music. In this position he
remained three years, when he went to America. From that
time there is no more account of him.</p>

<p>His pupil, <span class="smcap">Eugen Sandow</span>, born on September 11, 1856, in
Berlin, occupied himself from his sixth to his eighth year,
under the direction of his father, with violin playing; gave it
up however in favour of the Violoncello, and had as his next
teacher the royal chamber musician, A. Rohne. In 1870 he
was taken into the High School for Music, and was there,
from 1873 to 1876, Müller’s pupil. In April of the year 1879
ensued his appointment as Chamber Musician in the Royal
band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the beginning of the present century Hamburg has
been distinguished by excellent cellists. Foremost must be
brought forward here&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Nikolaus Prell.</span> He was born on November 6,
1773, in Hamburg, and earned the thanks of the musical
world there especially by the institution of regular Quartet
Academies. He died on March 18, 1849. His son&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">August Christian Prell</span>, under Romberg’s direction, whose
last pupil he was, reached a high degree of art. An extremely
beautiful and grand style of playing lent his performance a
classic stamp. Already at twelve years old he could perform
in public. Four years later the post of Chamber Musician in
Meiningen was offered to him, and in 1824 he received a
summons to Hanover as first Cellist of the Hofkapelle there,
to which he belonged until February 1, 1869, when he went
into retirement. He was born on August 1, 1805, and died on
September 3, 1885, in Hanau. His fine Amati Violoncello
passed into the possession of Grützmacher.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Georg Eduard Goltermann</span>, born on August 19, 1824, at
Hanover, A. Ch. Prell formed a distinguished Cellist. He
received the last touch from Joseph Menter during his two
years’ residence in Munich (1847-1849). He there also had
instruction in composition from Lachner. After he had made
some journeys from 1850-1852, he became music director in
Würzburg, but remained there only a year, for he was
summoned, in 1853, to be second Kapellmeister at the
Frankfort Theatre, and became in 1854 first Director.
Goltermann has also made himself eminent as a composer
for his instrument. For the Violoncello, besides
seven Concertos, he wrote a tolerable list of Drawing-room
Pieces, which have received a considerable degree of favour.</p>

<p>Two other famous Hamburg Cellists are the <span class="smcap">Brothers Lee</span>.
The elder, whose Christian name was Sebastian, was born on
December 24, 1805, in Hamburg, and was educated by Prell,
the father. At twenty-five years of age he made his first <i>début</i>
as solo player in his native town, as well as in Leipsic, and
then undertook a journey, by Cassel and Frankfort, to Paris,
where he arrived in April, 1832. He was heard then with
approbation in the Théâtre Italien. In 1836 he went to
London, and again returned to Paris, in order to join, as solo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
cellist, in the orchestra of the “Grand Opéra.” He devoted
himself to this work from 1837-1868, when he returned to
Hamburg, and died there on January 4, 1887. Seb. Lee
published a considerable number of compositions for his
instrument. Amongst them are Divertissements, Fantasias,
Variations, Etudes, as well as a great number of easy and
more difficult Duets, of which three books, under the title of
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecole du Violoncelliste à l’usage du Conservatoire de Paris</span>,”
have been published.</p>

<p>Two scholars of Seb. Lee worthy of mention are <span class="smcap">Böckmann</span>
and <span class="smcap">Bieler</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ferdinand Böckmann</span>, born January 28, 1843, at Hamburg,
enjoyed Lee’s instruction; and then Magnus Klitz,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> who was
at the time first Cellist at the Hamburg Stadt-Theatre,
was his master. In the autumn of 1861 he found an
appointment in the Dresden Court band, and was then,
for a time, Kummer’s pupil. Böckmann is a clever Violoncellist,
who made himself known extensively by the editing
of old Violoncello music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">August Bieler</span>, born on May 9, 1863, at Hamburg, began
his Cello studies under Lee, in his fourteenth year, and
continued them in Leipsic, where he went in January, 1879,
to be under Karl Schröder<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>; at Easter, in 1881, he was
received into the Sondershausen band, of which he has been
first Cellist since 1885. He is at the same time giving
instruction on his instrument at the Conservatoire of Sondershausen.
Bieler, who is possessed of a remarkable technique,
has distinguished himself both as a solo and quartet player.
His tone is powerful and full of energy, but, at the same time,
flexible and melodious, his manner of rendering full of
expression and extremely musical.</p>

<p>Lee’s younger brother, <span class="smcap">Louis</span>, who is reputed to have had
great skill in bowing, was born in Hamburg in 1819. He
also undertook several journeys, during which he appeared
at Leipsic, Cassel, Frankfort, Paris, and Copenhagen. He
published and wrote but very few cello compositions; amongst
them, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trois Pièces gracieuses</span>,” with piano accompaniment,
must have a prominent place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, another much valued Violoncellist of Hamburg,
<span class="smcap">Albert Gowa</span>, must be mentioned, who obtained his education
in the Leipsic Music School, but on the Violoncello especially
shared the instruction of F. Grützmacher and Davidoff. He
made himself advantageously known by his public appearances,
not only in German towns, but also in Copenhagen and
London; accepted an engagement from 1867-1868 at the
Philharmonic Society in his native town, and at the expiration
of this he was appointed solo cellist at the Bückeburg Court;
he then returned to Hamburg, where he is still living and
working. He was born on April 14, 1843.</p>

<p>Some other German distinguished Violoncellists of modern
times are Ripfel, Gross, Bockmühl, Néruda, and Alwin Schröder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl Ripfel</span> was a character, and moreover in his youth
was a so-called piano phenomenon, until the Minister of
Baden, de Touche, persuaded him to devote himself to Cello
playing, and himself gave him instruction. In regard to the
technical branch of his art he made great progress, but he
was so nervous that he could never make up his mind, except
during his youth, to appear in public. His manner of rendering
must have been <em>bizarre</em>. Nevertheless he was a distinguished
orchestra player; assisted by an extraordinary memory he was
able to play the cello part in the opera without music on an
occasion when his colleague would not turn over the page at
the right moment. He belonged to the Frankfort Theatre
orchestra for forty-five years. His grave has the inscription:
“Carl Ripfel, of Mannheim, died March 8, 1876, at
the age of seventy-seven years.” He must accordingly have
been born in the year 1799. In the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Signalen für die
Musikalische Welt</span>,” of March 19, 1876, the following is
asserted of him: “Although not known in an extensive
circle, he was esteemed by Bernhard Romberg to be the
greatest master of technique on his instrument, which he was
at last able to manipulate almost as well as Paganini.”</p>

<p>Ripfel was also a composer, but never published any of his
compositions. When the Violin virtuoso, Jean Becker, asked
him to let him have one of his string trios, he was roughly
refused.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Benjamin Gross</span>, born at Elbing, on September 12,
1809, went in his youth to Berlin in order to devote himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
there to the study of the Cello. It was not long before he
found a position in the orchestra of the Königstadt Theatre,
which he gave up in 1831. He now turned to Leipsic, was
often heard there, even in the Gewandhaus, and in 1833
joined the Liphart String Quartet, at Dorpat, at the head of
which was Ferdinand David. In 1835 he was engaged for
the Imperial Theatre in St. Petersburg as first Cellist, where
he continued until 1847. He then returned with a pension to
Germany, but soon appeared in St. Petersburg again, the
Grand Duke Michael having summoned him to his neighbourhood.
He did not long enjoy the pleasures of this intercourse,
for on September 1, 1848, he died of cholera. Of his compositions,
the number of which extend to about forty, there
appeared for the Violoncello a Concerto, Etudes, Duets,
Variations, and a variety of Drawing-room Pieces. He wrote
also a Concerto for Piano and Violoncello, as well as a Sonata
for these two instruments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Emil Bockmühl</span>, born 1820, in Frankfort-on-the-Maine,
died on November 3, 1881, was a clever Violoncellist,
and an industrious composer for his instrument. He published
about seventy works, consisting of “Fantasias,”
Variations, Divertissements, and Rondos on opera themes or
national songs. Also an extensive book of studies under the
title: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Études pour le développement du mécanisme du violoncelle;
adoptées pour l’étude élémentaire de cet instrument au
Conservatoire royal de musique de Bruxelles, et au Conservatoire
de musique de Bavière à Munich</span>” (Op. 17), in five
parts. At the beginning of his fiftieth year, Bockmühl settled
in Düsseldorf. At that time Robert Schumann was composing
his Violoncello Concerto, for which he solicited Bockmühl’s
advice in regard to the technical questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Franz Néruda</span>, born on December 3, 1843, at Brünn,
occupied himself from his fifth year with Violin, and from his
twelfth year with Violoncello playing, to which latter he
eventually devoted himself exclusively. In the year 1855 he
appeared publicly for the first time at Ischl. He then made
concert journeys in Germany and Russia, during which he
attained his twentieth year. In 1864 he was appointed to the
Copenhagen Court Kapelle, to which he belonged for twelve
years. During this time he was frequently heard as soloist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in Copenhagen, as well as in London, where he often took
Piatti’s place at the Popular Concerts. He also performed at
Concerts in Manchester and Liverpool. Latterly he appeared
at Vienna. Néruda studied under his father, although he was
indebted to Servais for many good hints. He published about
thirty of his Violoncello compositions, amongst them a Violoncello
Concerto, and some little pieces for Cello with Piano
accompaniment. It may be further remarked that he is
brother to the famous Violinist, Wilma Néruda.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alwin Schröder</span>, brother to Karl Schröder,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> was born at
Neuhaldensleben in 1855, where his father was music
director. He devoted himself to Violoncello playing only,
after he had pursued from the seventh year of his age piano,
violin, and tenor playing, and had attained to remarkable
proficiency in them. In his youth he was engaged in several
orchestras in Berlin as tenor performer. During a visit to his
father’s house he conceived a great desire to take up the
Violoncello, and practised on his own account the Cello
solo in the Introduction to Rossini’s “Tell” Overture. He
succeeded so well that his brother Karl, to whom he played it,
urged him to occupy himself further with the Violoncello,
which he did. In 1875 he had reached such a degree of proficiency
that he was engaged in the autumn of the same year
as first Cellist for the Liebig Orchestra. This position he
exchanged for one in the Fliegen Band. After he had been
a member of the Laube Kapelle, he chose Leipsic as his place
of residence in 1880, and occasionally took his brother Karl’s
work in the orchestra. When the latter accepted the post of
Royal Kapellmeister in Sondershausen, he was appointed in
his brother’s stead, together with Klengel,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> as first Cellist of
the Gewandhaus and Theatre Orchestra, as well as teacher in
the Conservatoire. Besides this, he is permanent member of
the Peter String Quartet. He received the title of Chamber
Virtuoso from the reigning Prince of Sondershausen. His
playing is famous for its clever technique, fine tone, perfect
accuracy, and most expressive rendering. He has been heard
in the capitals of Germany, Belgium, and Russia with
remarkable success.</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;FRANCE, BELGIUM, AND HOLLAND.</h3>


<p>The prominent position which the French attained in respect
to Violoncello playing in the second half of the last century
was maintained by them subsequently. They exercised, however,
with few exceptions, no real influence in Germany after
the period signalised by Romberg’s appearance. On the contrary,
this master influenced in a certain way French Cello
playing, as appears from a remark in Baudiot’s school,
mentioned on page <a href="#Page_104">104</a>, that Romberg had introduced the
use of the fourth finger in the thumb position. The
sign Ϙ, by which Romberg denoted the thumb position, also
was adopted in France, where, as in other places, it had been
necessary until then to use a variety of indications for it. In
other respects the aim of the French Violoncellists greatly
inclined in the virtuoso direction, as was the case with regard
to violin playing, whereas in Germany greater stress was
laid on the more solidly musical aspect, without neglecting the
virtuoso side.</p>

<p>Taking up the thread again from the preceding section with
France, the first to be mentioned is</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auguste Franchomme</span>. This artist, who belongs to the
most important masters of his department, was born at Lille
on April 10, 1808, and learnt the first elements of his
instrument from a mediocre teacher of his native town,
whose name was Mas. In 1825 he went to the Paris
Conservatoire as pupil of Levasseur, and, after the latter
retired from his professorship, Norblin undertook his further
instruction. Franchomme’s great talent developed so rapidly,
under the guidance of these two masters, that immediately,
during the first year of his attendance at the Conservatoire,
he gained the first prize at the musical competition of the
pupils of the establishment. He understood how to extract
from the instrument a full, sympathetic tone, and possessed
with an extraordinary intonation the rare gift of an
expressive and tasteful reading. He specially distinguished
himself by a charming <i>Cantilena</i>. It is easily understood
that on his public appearances he always aroused
the greatest enthusiasm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Franchomme filled various places successively in Paris.
He at first belonged, during the years 1825 and 1826, to
the orchestra of the Theatre “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ambigüe-Comique</span>.” He
then went over, in 1827, to the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Opéra</span>,” but
remained there only one year. He belonged for a longer
period to the Italian Opera, but he relinquished this position
after a few years. Instead, he established regular quartet
evenings with the famous violinist, Delphin Alard; and
in 1846 he undertook the Cello instruction at the Paris
Conservatoire. He died on January 21 or 22, 1884. His
compositions, consisting of a Concerto, Nocturnes, Etudes,
Variations, and a variety of smaller Drawing-room pieces, have
still some value for cello players. His best productions are
the Twelve Caprices (Op. 7), which for pieces of that kind
have every claim to consideration.</p>

<p>The best known pupils of Franchomme are <span class="smcap">Vidal</span> (the
younger), <span class="smcap">Jacquard</span>, and <span class="smcap">Barbot</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis Antoine Vidal</span>, born at Rouen on July 10, 1820,
devoted himself by preference to the literary branch of music
after he had finished his Cello studies. By his valuable work,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les instruments à archet</span>,” he attained to a prominent
position among the French writers on music of modern
times.</p>

<p>The younger <span class="smcap">Jacquard</span>, whose Christian name was Louis
Auguste, born on December 26, 1832, at Pont-le-Roy, so distinguished
himself as a scholar of the Paris Conservatoire, that
he gained in 1850 the second, and in 1852 the first prize. He
is a permanent member of the Orchestra of the Conservatoire
Concerts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jean François Barbot</span>, born in 1847 at Toulouse, settled
down in his native town after he had completed his studies at
the Paris Conservatoire, and is still at the present time
working there at his profession as an artist. Other modern
French cellists are&mdash;<span class="smcap">Battanchon</span>, <span class="smcap">Seligmann</span>, <span class="smcap">Dancla</span>, <span class="smcap">Lebouc</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Jacquard the elder</span>. They were all Norblin’s pupils.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felix Battanchon</span>, born on April 9, 1814, in Paris,
frequented the Conservatoire of his native town, and studied
there under Vaslin and Norblin, who turned him out as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
clever Cellist. After he had worked in various ways as a solo
player, he was appointed in 1840 to the orchestra at the
Grand Opéra. His compositions consist of Etudes, which are
fully adapted to the object in view and of which several books
have been published; Caprices, Duets, Trios (for three
Violoncellos), and light pieces of various kinds. His Op. 4,
which contains twenty-four Studies, has been introduced into
the Paris Conservatoire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hippolyte Prosper Seligmann</span>, whose name suggests a
German origin, was born on July 28, 1817, in Paris, entered
the Conservatoire there on December 2, 1829, and had
Norblin as his master for the Violoncello, and Halévy for
Composition. In 1834 he received the second prize and, two
years later, the first prize. After he left the Conservatoire,
in the middle of 1838, he played a great deal in public, and
in course of time made concert tours through Southern
France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Germany. For the
beauty of his tone he is indebted to a valuable Amati Cello of
large size. As a composer, Seligmann only cultivated the
lighter kind of music. His Violoncello pieces are no longer
used in solo playing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arnaud Dancla</span>, born January 1, 1820, at Bagnères-de-Bigorre,
was likewise Norblin’s pupil at the Paris Conservatoire.
He was dismissed, in 1840, with the first prize.
Dancla distinguished himself especially as a quartet player.
In Cello compositions, he published Etudes (Op. 2), two
books of Duets, a “Fantasia” on Themes from Auber’s
“Sirène,” “Melodies,” and a Cello School, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Violoncelliste
moderne</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Joseph Lebouc</span>, born on December 22, 1822, at
Besançon, attended the Conservatoire in Paris, and at first
had Vaslin as his teacher for a short time, but subsequently
Norblin. He also distinguished himself in playing chamber
music. Besides some pieces for Violoncello, with piano
accompaniment, he composed a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Methode complète et
pratique de Violoncelle</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leon Jean Jacquard</span>, the elder, born on November 3, 1826,
in Paris, passed his youth at Pont-le-Roy, near Blois. Hus-Desforges
had retired thither, and from him Jacquard received
his first cello instruction. When Hus-Desforges died, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
beginning of 1838, a certain Levacq undertook the further
direction of Jacquard, until he went to Paris to attend the
Conservatoire. Here he was in Norblin’s classes. He so
distinguished himself amongst his fellow scholars that he
received, in 1842, the second prize, and, in 1844, the first.</p>

<p>Jacquard enjoyed the reputation of a virtuoso-trained
player. He was, however, much appreciated as a member of
the orchestra of the Conservatoire Concerts, as well as of
the chamber music concerts instituted by the violinist,
Armingaud, in which also the violinist, Mas, and the tenor,
Sabatier, took part. It is a proof of his extraordinary ability,
that in 1877 he was appointed teacher in that institution as
Chevillard’s successor, whose pupil he had been. Nine years
later (March 27, 1886) death summoned him away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jacques Offenbach</span>, the creator of the Stage productions
which are known by the name of “Bouffes Parisiens,” was born
on June 21, 1819, at Cologne, and occupied himself zealously
with Violoncello playing in his younger years. Partly to
make himself more widely known, and partly to perfect
himself on his instrument, he went to Paris in 1842, and
shared for a time the instruction of the Vaslin Classes in the
Conservatoire. His efforts, however, to succeed as a Cellist
were in vain; according to the opinion of Fétis, because his
bowing was inefficient. In fact, he only succeeded in assisting
in the orchestra of the Comic Opera. This occupation did
not please him for any length of time; he withdrew and undertook
the office, in 1847, of <i>Chef d’Orchestre</i> at the Théâtre
Français. But Offenbach cherished more extensive plans,
which aimed at becoming a composer for the theatre. It is
known that he successfully attained to this, though not in the
way of gaining a very high reputation. Here, however, we
are considering Offenbach solely as a Violoncellist. Although
he did not perform as such in any very extraordinary manner,
yet he possesses claims to be noticed in this place, because
he wrote a number of Cello compositions which gained a
certain amount of favour. Besides some light pieces he
composed a considerable list of Duets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Auguste Tolbecque</span>, whose father was a distinguished pupil
of Rudolphe Kreutzer in violin playing, was born on March 30,
1830, in Paris, and went in his eleventh year to the Conser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>vatoire
as a pupil of Vaslin. In 1849 he obtained the
first prize. Since 1858 he has been living and working
at Niort, the chief town of the Department Deux-Sèvres.</p>

<p>Two other French cellists are Lasserre and Boubée.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jules Lasserre</span>, born on July 29, 1838, at Tarbes, went
from 1852-1855 to the Paris Conservatoire, and was dismissed
from there with the first prize. He then successfully undertook
journeys in France and Spain. In 1869 he settled down
in London as his permanent residence, and became first
Cellist in the “Musical Union” as well as in Costa’s Orchestra.
He wrote several things for his instrument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Albert Boubée</span>, born in 1850, at Naples, was originally
destined for commerce, and failing to persevere in this, it
was intended he should devote himself to teaching. But
neither in this could he succeed, and Boubée finally decided
for the musical profession. The enthusiasm excited in him
by his cello teacher, Gaetano Ciandelli, and later on by
Servais and Piatti’s playing, really induced him to pursue the
study of music. In 1867 Boubée chose London as his
residence, where since then he has become completely
naturalised, though from time to time he has accepted
engagements abroad. He worked on several occasions with
the orchestras at Spa and Scarborough, and travelled in Sweden,
Norway, and Denmark as a concert player, but he devotes
himself chiefly to the sphere of work which he has made for
himself in the English capital. Of his Cello compositions,
which consist of several solo pieces, the best known in England
is “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Gymnastique du Violoncelliste</span>.”</p>

<p>France possessed also a Violoncello virtuosa of reputation
about the middle of the century in <span class="smcap">Lisa B. Cristiani</span>, whose
name really points to an Italian descent. She played with
delicate intonation charming little pieces, pleasantly and
gracefully, and performed them on her journeys through
Germany and Denmark to Russia, and also on October 18,
1845, at Leipsic. The general approbation which was everywhere
lavished upon her was substantially increased by her
beautiful and imposing appearance. Felix Mendelssohn
considered it worth while to accompany her performances on
the piano at her Leipsic Concert, and to compose a “Song
without Words” for her. She was appointed Chamber Virtuosa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by the King of Denmark. In 1853 she died at Tobolsk, of
cholera. She was born at Paris, on December 24, 1827.</p>

<p>At the present time the best French cellists are: <span class="smcap">Jules
Delsart</span>, <span class="smcap">Rabaud</span> (both teachers at the Paris Conservatoire),
<span class="smcap">Liègeois</span>, <span class="smcap">Loeb</span>, and <span class="smcap">Becker</span>. Information regarding them is
lacking up to the present time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Belgium and Holland the Violoncello was introduced
about the same time as in France, though it made, indeed,
but slow progress in both these countries. This may be
concluded by the very modest number of Belgian and Dutch
Cellists worthy of mention in the last century, of which there
are only four to notice. The oldest of these,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wilhelm de Fesch</span>, born in the Netherlands towards the
end of the seventeenth century, was not only cellist, but
organist. In the latter capacity he worked at the Antwerp
Cathedral until 1725, when he undertook, as d’Eve’s<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> successor,
the office of Choirmaster. But as he treated somewhat
roughly the boys of the church choir entrusted to his direction,
he was dismissed in 1731, when he betook himself to London.
He was still living there in 1757, as appears from the portrait
of him in that year by Lacave. Amongst his published
compositions mentioned by Burney as dry and uninteresting,
there are also six Violoncello solos printed at Amsterdam
(Op. 8). After Fesch,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter Wilhelm Winkis</span> must be mentioned. Born in 1735
at Liège, he did not remain at home, but travelled to
Germany, where for a few years he was in the service
of the Cassel Court, and then (at the beginning of 1788), as
Gerber notices, became Chamber Musician and Violoncellist
to the “Kapellinstitut” of the Queen of Prussia. He well
understood how to accompany with “much taste and
observation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The third Violoncellist of consideration is</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jean Arnold Dammen</span> (Fétis calls him Jean André Dahmen),
who belonged to a large Dutch musical family, was born
in 1760, at the Hague, and had the reputation of being a clever
player. About 1769 he was living in London. Of his
compositions, several books of Duets and Sonatas appeared.
In 1794 he was appointed to Drury Lane, and in the years
1796 and 1797 he travelled in South Germany.</p>

<p>Finally we must here mention <span class="smcap">Joseph Müntzberger</span>. He
was of German extraction, and was born in Brussels in 1769,
where his father, Wenzeslaus Müntzberger, was chamber
musician in the service of Prince Charles of Lorraine, Governor
of the Netherlands. Fétis informs us that the young Müntzberger
at six years of age played a Concerto before the
Prince, on a tenor viol, handled somewhat like the
Violoncello. On account of this performance he was
induced to have the boy instructed by the violinist, Van
Maldere. This account must be erroneous, for Van Maldere
died on November 3, 1768, a year before Müntzberger’s birth.
In his fourteenth year he went to Paris. He there advanced
himself&mdash;with the sole assistance of Tillière’s Violoncello School&mdash;so
far that he was able to play the most difficult pieces of the
Cello literature of that period. In 1790 he accepted a place
in the orchestra of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre Lyrique et Comique</span>,” but
after a time gave it up and entered the orchestra of the “Théâtre
Feydeau,”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> of which he became first cellist after Cardon’s
resignation. Besides this, he was a member of Napoleon the
First’s band, as well as, later, of the King’s. During his
official occupation he often assisted at concerts, and specially
at those of the “Rue de Cléry,” which at the beginning of
this century were in great favour with the Parisians. In 1830
he retired on a pension, and died in January, 1844.</p>

<p>Müntzberger, who, during his long residence in Paris, had
not only Gallicised himself as an artist, but also in regard to
the pronunciation of his name, composed a good deal for the
Violoncello&mdash;namely, five Concertos, a “Symphonie Concertante,”
Trios, in which, besides the Cello obbligato, the violin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and bass take part; a great number of Duets, Fantasias, and
Variations; two books of Sonatas, with bass; three of Etudes
and Caprices, as well as a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouvelle Méthode pour le Violoncelle</span>.”
The latter work in all probability appeared before 1800,
as in it, as in Boccherini’s compositions, besides the bass and
tenor and violin clefs, the alto and soprano clefs are used,
which do not occur in French books of instruction after this
date.</p>

<p>Violoncello playing received a remarkable impulse in Belgium
towards the middle of our century. Platel (mentioned already
on p. <a href="#Page_101">101</a>) greatly contributed to this by founding the school of
Violoncello playing which subsequently gained such reputation.
From it came out prominently,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrien François Servais</span>, born on June 6, 1807, at Hal,
near Brussels. He began his career, like so many of his
colleagues, with violin playing, in which his father, who was
a musician in the church at Hal, first gave him instruction,
and under whom he became acquainted with the elements of
theory. The child’s rare talent inspired the art-loving
Marquis de Sayve, who possessed an estate in the neighbourhood
of Hal, with so great an interest that he granted him
the means of beginning to study in earnest under the direction
of the first violinist of that time in the Brussels Theatre, of
the name of Van der Planken. In Brussels, Servais soon
found an opportunity of hearing Platel, whose playing made
a deep impression on him, and excited in him the desire of
devoting himself to Violoncello playing. In order to become
Platel’s pupil, he applied for admission to the Brussels Conservatoire.
His development was so rapid that he surpassed all
his fellow-students, and gained, before the year was over, the
first prize in the competition. Platel made him his assistant in
the Conservatoire, and at the same time he was placed in the
opera orchestra, to which he belonged for three years.
During this period, however, he did not succeed in gaining
from his fellow countrymen the appreciation which he soon
after gained in Paris.</p>

<p>In the year 1834 Servais went to London. He acquired
there also remarkable success; but the applause of the public
did not excite in him self-satisfied content, for when he returned
home he gave himself up to renewed study, by means of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he attained to the highest degree of masterly performance.
In the beginning of 1836 he went to Paris&mdash;the following year
he travelled in Holland, and in 1839 visited St. Petersburg,
where he met with a brilliant reception. Such was the case
also when he re-appeared in his native land, and performed at
Brussels and Antwerp, after his return from Russia. In the
beginning of 1841 he undertook a second journey to the East,
in which he aroused great applause at St. Petersburg, Moscow,
Warsaw, Prague, and Vienna by his performances. In 1843
he gave concerts again in Holland, and the following year in
Germany, after which he again went to Russia. In the winter
of 1847 he was in Paris and later on he travelled into Scandinavia.
Now a quieter time was in store for him, for in 1848,
after he had been nominated solo violinist to the King of the
Belgians, he undertook the Professorship at the Brussels Conservatoire,
which for a time attached him to the place. At the
beginning of 1866 he made another journey to Russia, which
he extended to Siberia. It is supposed that by these unceasing
efforts Servais laid the seeds of his death, which took
place on November 26 of the same year, at his birthplace,
whither he had resorted to recruit his health.</p>

<p>Servais was not only a virtuoso of the first rank, but also
a thoroughly original artist who was the means of effecting
an important advance in Cello playing, by opening out for it
new lines. His performance was distinguished by broad,
energetic, and rich intonation, as well as by the most
careful finish and effective manipulation, for he understood
how to bring out into the clearest light all the advantages of
his instrument. Many connoisseurs consider him the first
cellist of his time; in any case, he competed successfully with
his French colleagues, and raised the Belgian school of
Violoncello playing to extraordinary reputation.</p>

<p>Servais as a composer for his instrument is well-deserving
of notice. Besides three Concertos, he wrote ten Fantasias,
with orchestral accompaniment. He united with J. Grégoire
in composing fourteen Duets for Piano and Violoncello, and
with the violinist Léonard three Duets for Violin and Violoncello,
upon opera themes. In conjunction also with Henri
Vieuxtemps, a Duet of the same kind was produced. Finally,
he composed six Caprices in the Etude form, which, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
are not so attractive as many of his other Cello pieces.
Amongst these the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Souvenir de Spa</span>” and Variations on
Schubert’s Sehnsucht Valses have had the widest circulation.</p>

<p>Of the numerous pupils whom Servais formed, the best
known are&mdash;Meerens, Deswert, Fischer, and Bekker.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Meerens</span>, born at Bruges on December 26, 1831,
is the son of a clever flutist, who in 1845 settled in Antwerp,
where young Meerens received his first Cello instruction from
Joseph Bessems. Later, a certain Dumon, in Ghent, was his
teacher. Having returned to his birthplace, Bruges, he
founded an amateur musical society, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Francs-Amis</span>,” and
superintended a music warehouse established by his father.
In 1855 he went to Brussels in order to study music under
Servais’s direction, but subsequently devoted his chief attention
to writing on music, especially in relation to acoustics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jules Deswert</span>, the most prominent pupil of Servais, and
altogether one of the best of Belgian cellists, was born on
August 1, 1843, at Louvain, and made himself a name, after
having completed his studies under Servais, by several concert
journeys. In 1865 he stopped at Düsseldorf, and was for a time
engaged there. Three years later he entered the Weimar Hofkapelle
as first Cellist, whence he was summoned to Berlin, in
1869, with the title of Concertmaster, as solo cellist of the Royal
band and teacher in the High School of Music. He gave up
this in 1873 in order to devote himself to composition. After
he had remained a few years in Wiesbaden, he chose Leipsic
as his residence in 1881. Besides two operas, of which
the one called “The Albigenses” was brought out in 1878 at
Wiesbaden, and the other, “Graf Hammerstein,” in 1884
in Mayence, he wrote three Cello Concertos, as well as an
important number of Drawing-room Pieces, re-edited a
collection of old Violoncello music and arrangements of
classical compositions, and published three books of Etudes
under the title of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Mecanisme du Violoncelle</span>.” He also
produced a Cello school, which was brought out by Novello,
in London. Servais also formed a very distinguished artist in
the Cellist,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adolphe Fischer</span>, born November 22, 1850, in Brussels,
whose name implies a German origin. His father, who
worked in the Belgian capital as conductor, and founded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
first Society for men-singers, prepared him for attending
the Brussels Conservatoire. His education, under the
guidance of Servais, went rapidly forward. At sixteen years
of age the first prize was conferred on him. After his
studies were completed, Fischer chose Paris as his residence,
and soon met with general appreciation. Since then he
has undertaken several concert tours in the larger towns of
Germany.</p>

<p>The violoncellist, <span class="smcap">P. R. Bekker</span>, born on May 23, 1839,
in the Dutch town of Winschoten, was pupil of the Brussels
School of Music from 1852-1855. He progressed so far
under Servais that he soon received the first prize at
the playing competition. Bekker sought and found a sphere
of work as music teacher at Utrecht. A testimony to the
excellence of his performances is the circumstance that, in
1861, he was granted the title of solo Violoncellist by the King
of Holland. He did not, however, long enjoy the fruits of his
industry, for he died in 1875.</p>

<p>Servais educated also the elder of his two sons, whose
Christian name was <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>, as a very good cellist. From
1869-1870 he belonged to the Weimar orchestra. In the year
1872 he was nominated professor of his instrument at the
Brussels Conservatoire. He was born November 23, 1850, at
Hal, the home of his father, where he died August 28 or 29,
of the year 1885.</p>

<p>Returning to Platel’s pupils, we have, after the elder
Servais, <span class="smcap">François Demunck</span> (De Munck) to mention, who was
born on October 6, 1815, in Brussels, where his father was
teacher of music. Instructed by him in the first elements of
the art, he entered the Conservatoire of his birthplace as a boy
of ten years of age, and soon had Platel as his master. In 1834
he left the Institution with the first prize, and in the following
year he was nominated as his master’s assistant. When
the latter died a few months after, Demunck was appointed his
successor. His star was gradually in the ascendant. Fétis
says of him that, about 1840, the hope was cherished that he
was destined to be at the head of the Violoncellists of his time,
for his playing was distinguished not only by the opposite fine
qualities of energetic and delicate intonation, but also by an
expression full of feeling, and ease in surmounting all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
difficulties. This hope was not, however, to be fulfilled.
Demunck fell into relations which had a paralysing effect
on the work of his profession. He neglected more and
more the study of the Cello; consequently his performances
were deprived of their precision and brilliancy; and, further,
he ruined his health. Notwithstanding this he still excited
some consideration in London. Soon after, in the year
1845, he resigned his official work, in order to perform
at concerts, in company with a singer, in Germany.
His performances, however, no longer came up to the
cherished expectations. In the year 1848 Servais stepped
into Demunck’s place as teacher at the Brussels Conservatoire,
which induced him to go to London, and labour for a time
in the orchestra of “Her Majesty’s” Theatre. But only
too soon the results of his dissolute life became apparent.
He fell into doubtful circumstances, and, broken in body and
mind, he returned, in the spring of 1853, to Brussels, where,
on February 28 of the following year, he died.</p>

<p>Demunck published only a “Fantasia” with variations on a
Russian theme (Op. 1).</p>

<p>Of his two sons he brought up the younger, by name
<span class="smcap">Ernest</span>, as cellist, who was born in Brussels on December 21,
1840. As early as eight years of age he was able to
appear as a solo player in his native place, and at ten
in London. He then became, for a time, Servais’s pupil in
the Brussels Conservatoire. Later, in company with Julien,
he travelled all over Great Britain, then settled in London,
but in 1868 went to Paris, was there for two years member
of the Maurin String Quartet, and accepted, in 1871, the
invitation made to him to be first Cellist of the Weimar
orchestra. His work for many years suffered impediment
from an injury to his left hand. Since his marriage with
Carlotta Patti he has resided in America.</p>

<p>As one of the elder Demunck’s pupils deserving notice,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guillaume Paque</span> must be mentioned, born at Brussels
on July 24, 1825. At ten years of age he became a pupil
of the Conservatoire, where, during a course of six years,
he received his entire artistic training. Dismissed from the
institution with the first prize, he entered the orchestra of
the Royal Theatre in his native town. After he had belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to it for some years, he took up his abode in Paris, with
the intention of permanently settling there. But an offer
which he received in 1840, of entering, as solo cellist, the
Italian Opera at Barcelona, induced him to leave the French
capital. Scarcely had he arrived at Barcelona, when the
Professorship of the Musical School was committed to him.
In 1849 he played before the Queen of Spain in Madrid, and
in 1850 he travelled in the South of France giving concerts.
In the same year he fixed his residence in London, where he
gained popularity as a chamber music player. He found his
particular sphere of work as solo cellist at the Royal Italian
Opera, as well as teacher at the London Academy of Music,
until his death on March 3, 1876. Amongst his compositions
he published several “Fantasias,” Variations, and Drawing-room
pieces.</p>

<p>The elder Demunck had a second famous pupil in</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isidore Deswert</span>, not to be confounded with the Violoncellist
of the same name already mentioned. Isidore
Deswert, the son of a musician established at Louvain, was
born there on January 6, 1830, and, after he had completed
his studies at the Brussels Conservatoire, he received
the first prize at the playing competition. In 1850 he found
a position as teacher at the music school of his native town,
and six years later he was invested with the office of solo
cellist at the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre de la Monnaie</span>,” in Brussels. Since
December 3, 1866, he has been occupied as Director of the
Violoncello Class at the Conservatoire there.</p>

<p>Of Platel’s pupils we have still to mention Batta and Van
Volxem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Batta</span>, born on July 9, 1816, at Maestricht,
received from his father, a singing master, his first instruction
in music, and at first practised violin playing. After
some time his father was appointed “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">professeur de solfège</span>”
at the Brussels Conservatoire, and in consequence the family
Batta took up their abode in the Belgian capital. There the
talented boy heard the Cello master, Platel, play, and the
desire of emulating him was awakened. He succeeded
in inducing his father to let him share Platel’s instruction at
the Conservatoire. By persevering industry he succeeded in
gaining the first prize with Demunck at the competition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
his class in 1834. In 1835 he went to Paris, where he found
a good reception. This decided him to make it his home.</p>

<p>At this time the tenor, Rubini, was flourishing in Paris.
All vied in doing him homage, and Batta became such an
unbounded admirer of him, that he copied his manner of
rendering. It is known that instrumentalists can learn a
great deal from good singers. Rubini, however, with all the
advantages of his manner of singing, had the failing of making
excessive contrasts of <i>forte</i> and <i>piano</i> without the use of intermediate
gradations, in order to produce startling effects upon
the public. Batta appropriated this merely for the sake of
attaining an easy effect, and therefore became for a time the
recognized darling of the Parisian public, and especially of
the ladies, whom he knew how to captivate by his sweetly
coquettish style of playing. He naturally possessed also
valuable artistic qualities, but an apparently virtuoso tendency
ever after clung to him.</p>

<p>Batta published a respectable list of Drawing-room pieces
and transcriptions, as well as a Concerto and a couple of
Concert Etudes for his instrument. These productions were
for a time made use of by violoncellists: now they have
ceased to excite any interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. B. Van Volxem</span>, born on November 30, 1817, at Ucclelès-Bruxelles,
became, in 1833, a student of the Brussels
Conservatoire as a pupil of Platel. At the competition he
gained the second prize for Cello playing and composition.
Later on he was Chorus Director in the Brussels Royal Theatre.
Since then he has by preference devoted himself to chorus
singing, and has deserved considerable merit for its diffusion
in Belgium.</p>

<p>Three other Belgian violoncellists must be added to those
artists already mentioned, namely: Chevillard, Warot, and
Vieuxtemps, of whom the first-named is distinguished as by
far the most important and most famous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre Alexandre François Chevillard</span>, born on January 15,
1811, at Antwerp, received&mdash;after he had been prepared for the
musical profession in the parental home&mdash;his higher education,
as a pupil of Norblin, in the Paris Conservatoire, to which he
belonged from March 15, 1820, until the year 1827. Dismissed
from thence with the first prize, he undertook the duties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
solo cellist in the orchestra of the “Théâtre Gymnase.” In
this position, which afforded him abundant leisure for pursuing
the study of composition under Fétis’s direction, he remained
until 1831. He then became member of the orchestra of the
Italian Opera. In the year 1859 he undertook the Professoriate
at the Paris Conservatoire in Vaslin’s place.</p>

<p>Chevillard distinguished himself not only as a trained
virtuoso player, but also as a musician animated by a high
artistic aim, which he proved by his efforts to introduce the
last String Quartets of Beethoven into Parisian musical circles,
for whom these magnificent “tone poems” had until then
been an unknown world. After repeated fruitless attempts,
which failed on account of the insufficient intelligence of his
associate players, he at length succeeded by means of the artists
Maurin, Sabattier, and Mas, who had the same aim in view,
in gaining the requisite force by which he was able to carry
out his ideas. At first the quartet confederates established
private performances before a few connoisseurs only. By
degrees, however, the number of the audience increased, so
that they ventured on a public hearing, which took place in the
Pleyel Saloon. During the years 1855 and 1856 the four
players undertook tours in Germany in order to perform the last
Beethoven Quartet at Cologne, Frankfort, Darmstadt, Leipsic,
Berlin, and Hanover. Everywhere they found the appreciation
which they deserved. In the year 1868 Demunck the younger
joined the Quartet in the place of Chevillard, who died at the
end of 1877.</p>

<p>Chevillard’s cello compositions were a “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concerto, Quinze
Mélodies, Morceaux developpés pour Violoncelle et Orchestre
ou Piano</span>,” a “Fantasia” on Themes from Marino Falliero
“Lamenti, Adagio and Finale,” and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Andante et Barcarolle</span>.”
Besides these he published a Cello school which bears the
title: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méthode complète de Violoncelle, contenant la théorie
de l’instrument, des gammes, leçons progressives, études, airs
variés et leçons pour chacune des positions</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constant Noël Adolphe Warot</span>, born on November 28, 1812,
at Antwerp, began early the practice of music on the violin,
but gave up this instrument in favour of the violoncello. In
1852 he was appointed teacher at the Brussels Conservatoire.
Besides a Violoncello School, which was introduced as a work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of instruction to the Art Institute mentioned, he wrote Duets
for two Violoncellos, and an “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Air Varié</span>” with piano accompaniment.
He died on April 10, 1875, at the place of his work.</p>

<p>Concerning <span class="smcap">Jules Joseph Ernest Vieuxtemps</span>, the younger
brother of the celebrated Violin virtuoso of the same name,
nothing more is known than the fact that he was for a long
time solo cellist at the Italian Opera in London, and that he
is at present solo player in Hallé’s Orchestra at Manchester.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amongst the Dutch Violoncellists we have&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Andreas Ten Cate</span>, born in 1796, at Amsterdam. He was
originally destined for a commercial calling, but at the age of
fourteen he decided for the musical career, and became Jan
Georg. Bertelmann’s pupil. In his riper years he devoted
himself chiefly to composition for the stage. He wrote,
however, some instrumental pieces; amongst them a couple
of Violoncello Concertos. He died on July 27, 1858.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jacques Franco-Mendès</span>, who descends from a Portuguese
family settled for a long time in Amsterdam, has exercised a
great, indeed the greatest influence on Dutch cello playing.
He was born in 1816<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> in the said town, and in his earliest
years began the practice of music. He received instruction
from Präger on the Violoncello, from Bertelmann in theory,
and, in order to educate himself still further in cello playing,
he went to Merk, at Vienna, in 1829.</p>

<p>Until then Franco-Mendès was undecided as to whether he
should pursue music for his pleasure or as his career. He
soon decided for the latter, and undertook with his brother
Joseph, who was a gifted violin player, a journey to London
and Paris in the year 1831. He made his <i>début</i> in the
former city at a concert given by Nepomuk Hummel and on
his return to Amsterdam he received from the King of
Holland the title of Chamber Violoncellist. In 1833 the
brothers Franco-Mendès undertook together a concert tour
in Germany, and were heard with success in Frankfort,
Leipsic, and Dresden. In the following year Jacques was
nominated first solo Cellist of the King of Holland. In 1836<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
he again went with his brother to Paris. The latter died in
1841, and this loss so heavily affected Jacques that for a
long time he could not resolve to undertake any more art
journeys but played only at a few concerts in the chief towns
of Holland. In 1845 the desire was again aroused in him of
making further efforts. He took part, in that year, in the
musical festival which was held at Bonn to celebrate the
unveiling of the Beethoven memorial, but on account of the
overwhelming number of musical productions he gained no
success. In 1860 he took up his permanent abode in Paris.
As a composer, Franco-Mendès proved that to a certain extent
his aim was worthy of respect, for he occupied himself with
chamber music in its more serious aspect. He wrote two
Quintets and a String Quartet, one of which was distinguished
by receiving a prize from the Netherlands “Society for the
advancement of Music.” He has also composed a long list of
Drawing-room pieces for his instrument, amongst them a grand
Duo for two Violoncellos, an Elégie, “Fantasias,” “Caprices,”
and more pieces of the same kind; some of them are still
performed, as, for example, the Adagio (Op. 48).</p>

<p>Among Franco-Mendès’ pupils,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Ernest Appy</span> must be cited, who, springing from
French parentage, was born on October 25, 1834, at the Hague.
His father was a tenor player in the Royal band, but
went away with his family to Amsterdam, where his son at
fourteen years of age began with piano playing under Richard
Hol. A year after he gave it up for the Violoncello, on which
the Belgian, Charles Montigny, and later, Merlen, the first
cellist at Amsterdam, gave him instruction. He received
the final finish from Franco-Mendès, under whom he also
studied composition.</p>

<p>Appy began his work as a musician in 1851, as member of
the Concert orchestra at Zaandam. He soon received
invitations to the provincial towns of his Fatherland to assist
as a solo player at concerts, and in 1854 he was engaged for
six months by Joseph Gungl, as solo cellist for Scotland.
Two years later he was member of the Amsterdam Park
orchestra, as well as of the orchestra of the “Felix Meritis”
Society. In 1857 he worked for six months at the concerts
of the London Crystal Palace, and after his return he joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the orchestra of the “Cäcelia” Society in Amsterdam. From
1862 he has belonged to the String Quartet of the excellent
violinist, Franz Coenen, for nine years, by which means he
has enjoyed the opportunity of playing with distinguished
artists, such as Ernst Lübeck, Alfred Jaël, and Madame
Clara Schumann.</p>

<p>In the year 1864 Appy was appointed Cello teacher to the
“<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Maatschappij tot Bevordering van Toonkunst</span>,” in which office
he remained till 1883. During this time, in 1871, he went
for six months to New York, in order to join in the Thomas
Concerts as soloist. His substitute as teacher at the
Amsterdam Maatschappij was, meantime, Daniel de Lange.</p>

<p>Returned to Holland, Appy took up his residence in Haarlem,
where he gave lessons on the Cello and Piano. Thence
he again went to Amsterdam and opened there a prosperous
music school, which he continues to superintend at the
present time. His cello compositions consist of “Fantasias”
on <i>Motifs</i> from the “Freischütz” and “Robert le Diable,” as
well as some smaller light pieces.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned <span class="smcap">Daniel de Lange</span>, born about 1840,
at Rotterdam, was educated as a cellist by Simon Ganz and
Servais, while Verhulst was his master in theory. On the
completion of his studies he travelled with his brother, the
pianist and organist, Samuel de Lange, through Austria and
went to the music school at Lemberg, to which he belonged
for three years. In 1863 he returned home and undertook the
Cello instruction at the Rotterdam Music School, which his
master Ganz had until then carried on. There is no further
information regarding him.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jacques Rensburg</span>, born May 22, 1846, at Rotterdam, also
began his cello studies under Ganz in his ninth year, and
continued them under Giese, Daniel de Lange, and Emil
Hegar.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Rensburg was destined for a commercial and not
an artistic career, but his inclination for music so increased
with time, that in 1867 he received permission from his
father to devote himself to Art. He now went about the
middle of the year named to Cologne, in order to pursue
a course under the talented Violoncellist, Schmitt. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
latter, however, was already, in consequence of a chest
malady which, later, carried him off, so suffering that
Rensburg’s wish was not fulfilled of learning from him.
Instead of becoming Schmitt’s pupil he was his temporary
assistant, as first Cellist in the orchestra of the Gürzenich
Concerts, as well as teacher in the Rhenish School of Music
at Cologne. Both offices were given over to him definitely on
April 1, 1868, on account of his valuable services, for,
in the meantime, Schmitt had died. Besides his official duty,
Rensburg frequently performed with favourable success in the
tours of the Rhenish Provinces, as well as in North Germany,
and in 1872, also, in the Leipsic Gewandhaus as a soloist;
but the ceaseless application with which he practised his profession
brought on a nervous affection, which compelled him
to retire into private life. In the autumn of 1874 he went to
his native town, and since the spring of 1880 he has been
living at Bonn, where he is partner in a mercantile undertaking.
Of his compositions have appeared: “Recitative,
Adagio, and Allegro, in the form of a Concerto.”</p>

<p>An excellent Dutch Violoncellist is <span class="smcap">Louis Lübeck</span>, born on
February 14, 1838, at the Hague. His father, the “Hof-Kapellmeister,”
Johann Heinr. Lübeck, so highly esteemed by the
Dutch musical world (died on February 7, 1865, at the Hague),
gave him his first regular instruction, after he had up to his
seventeenth year occupied himself with music as a dilettante.
In order still further to perfect himself he studied from
1857-1859 under Léon Jacquard’s direction in Paris. He then
made successful journeys through France and Holland, took
up his residence in Colmar, where he often joined in concerts
with Clara Schumann and Jul. Stockhausen; in 1866 he
was summoned to Leipsic as first cellist at the Gewandhaus
Concerts and teacher at the Conservatoire. He fulfilled
these duties until 1868, in which year he occupied a similar
position in Frankfort-on-the-Maine, and he also undertook fresh
concert journeys through Germany, Holland, and England.
In the year 1871 Lübeck was a member of the Carlsruhe
“Capelle.” He did not, however, remain long in this position,
but he next went, in 1873, to Berlin and St. Petersburg. From
the latter place he went to Sondershausen, where he
belonged to the Ducal Band as soloist, and afterwards to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
North America. In the year 1881 he returned to Europe, and
was engaged as successor to the Concertmaster, Jul. Stahlknecht,
for the Berlin Royal Band, to which he still
belongs as solo cellist. Besides a collection of small pieces,
amongst which are some transcriptions, Lübeck has written
two Concertos, of which, however, only one has until now been
published.</p>

<p>Bouman and Maaré belong to the younger Dutch Violoncellists
who have become prominent by their performances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antoon Bouman</span>, born in Amsterdam, in the year 1855,
received his first instruction from one of his brothers, with
whom he later for some time established regular Quartet
Conversaziones. As a boy of twelve years he was able to
appear before the King, William III., as well as at the public
Concerts of his native city. In order to make further progress
he attended the Rotterdam Conservatoire and enjoyed there
the cello instruction of O. Eberle.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Returning home he again
played before the King, who granted him the means of
continuing his studies. He thus was able to work for some
years in order to perfect himself, and had the advantage of
the advice of Aug. Lindner, in Hanover; Fr. Grützmacher, in
Dresden; Joseph Servais, in Brussels; and Léon Jacquard,
in Paris. He then travelled in Southern France and England,
where, during a residence of four years, he gave concerts with
success. Since then he has acquired for himself a lucrative
sphere of work in Utrecht as Director of the municipal
concerts, as solo player and cello teacher. Besides several
smaller compositions, Bouman has written two Concertos
for his instrument.</p>

<p>From Eberle, who, as we have just seen, was for a time
Bouman’s master, <span class="smcap">Th. C. de Maaré</span>, born on January 14,
1863, also received his education as a Violoncellist. In his
twenty-second year he received the appointment at the
“<span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Amsterdamsche Orkestvereenigung</span>” of solo cellist, when
the place of first solo player at the Royal “Fransche Opera”
was also given to him, which position he still holds.</p>

<p>The two youngest cellists of Holland, of talent worth
mentioning, are Snoer and Smith.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Johan Snoer</span> was born on June 28, 1868, in Amsterdam,
and received his first instruction from Alexander Pohle, a
pupil of Fr. Grützmacher. After Pohle’s death the younger
Giese<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> was his master, and, when the latter went out to
America, Henry Bosman undertook his training. Later on
he learned the harp from Edm. Schuëcker, now teacher at the
Leipsic Conservatoire. Snoer began his active career as a
volunteer in the Amsterdam Park Orchestra. When he was
dismissed from this he was appointed Violoncellist and
Harpist at the newly-erected Park Theatre at Amsterdam.
Since 1885 he has been first solo cellist and harpist at the
Amsterdam Orchestra Union.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johannes Smith</span>, born on January 27, 1869, at Arnheim,
received his first Cello instruction from Heyn,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> in Maestricht,
where his father had been placed in the Dutch service.
Later on the Smith family resided in Amsterdam and there
Ernest Appy was the teacher of the artist boy, who went to
Dresden in 1883 in order to complete his training on the
Violoncello under Fr. Grützmacher and, in theory, under
Felix Draeseke. Since then Smith has appeared with great
success in Leipsic, Dresden, Berlin, and the Hague, as concert
player.</p>




<h3>VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">England and Scandinavia.</span></h3>


<p>The special attention which had been devoted to the Viola da
Gamba in England during the seventeenth century<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> was not
paid, in similar measure, to the Violoncello. This instrument,
like the Gamba, was introduced into musical circles in
London by Italians. Ariosti, Bononcini, Cervetto, and
Caporale&mdash;all contributed to make it familiar in the English
capital and other places. But it does not appear that
Violoncello playing was taken up by English artists at first
with the same alacrity as it was abroad&mdash;at all events, as a
profession&mdash;and this left the field open chiefly to foreign
Violoncellists, who came to England with the hope of a rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
harvest, in which, says M. Wasielewski, they were too
often disappointed. The number of professional English
cellists is small as compared with those of other countries,
though there are a few to be mentioned who, in talent and
proficiency, will bear comparison with any of the great players
of their time.</p>

<p>One of the first is</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barthol. Johnson</span>, probably born in 1710, as he is said
to have celebrated his hundredth birthday at Scarborough,
October 3, 1810, when Lord Mulgrave and many distinguished
persons were present in the Freemasons’ Hall. During the
evening the centenarian played the Bass of a Minuet on the
cello, which he had composed sixty years before. (See
<a href="#B">Appendix</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Hebden</span>, who is supposed to have played the Violoncello,
was probably born at the beginning of the eighteenth
century, since his portrait was engraved by Faber in 1741.
He is represented in this playing the Gamba. Gerber, at
least, seems to have thought it worth while to mention him as
a cellist, though Burney writes of a certain Hebden as playing
the Bassoon at a concert in London where the best performers
of the Italian opera were employed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Paxton</span> also was a violoncellist, the composer of
the well-known glee “Breathe soft, ye winds,” besides other
pieces. Burney praises his “full and sweet tone, as well as
his judicious manner of accompanying the voice.” He
published amongst his other compositions also six Duos
for two Violoncellos (Op. 1), eight Duos for Violin and
Violoncello (Op. 2), six solos for Violin (Op. 3), four
solos for Violin and two for the Violoncello (Op. 4), twelve
easy lessons for Violoncello (Op. 6), and six solos for Violoncello
(Op. 8). His brother Stephen also composed for the
Cello.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Crosdill</span>, born in London in 1755,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> whom Gerber
mentions as an extraordinarily clever Violoncellist, and Fétis
as distinguished, notwithstanding the presence of Mara in
England, had a high reputation in his time. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
educated in the choir of Westminster Abbey under Robinson
and Cooke; on leaving the choir he studied the violoncello
under his father, and is said to have had instruction
from Jean Duport. He soon acquired a considerable
proficiency, and in 1768 he was elected a member of the
Royal Society of Musicians. In the following year he played
at the Gloucester Festival, and was appointed first cellist, an
appointment which he held until his retirement. In 1776 he
was engaged as first Violoncellist at the Concerts of Ancient
Music, and in 1778 as Violist of the Chapel Royal. He
probably went to Paris 1778-9, and remained nine months,
studying under the elder Janson. In 1782 he was appointed
chamber musician to Queen Charlotte, and he also gave
lessons to the Prince of Wales. About 1788 he married a
lady of fortune, and retired from the practice of his profession,
appearing publicly for one day only, in 1821, at the coronation
of George IV. He died at Escrick, in Yorkshire, leaving
a considerable fortune to his son, who, by his father’s desire,
presented a donation of £1,000 to the Society of Musicians.</p>

<p>Four other English Cellists of the second half of last
century are&mdash;Hardy, Reinagle I. and II., and Gunn.</p>

<p>Little is known of <span class="smcap">Hardy</span>, Henry (of Oxford), beyond the
fact that about 1800 he published an instruction book with
the title, “The Violoncello Preceptor, with a compleat set of
Scales for fingering in the various keys,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Reinagle</span>, born in 1762, at Portsmouth, was the
son of a German music teacher who emigrated to England.
He was originally intended for the navy, but gave it up after
his first voyage. He was apprenticed then to a goldsmith
in Edinburgh, but neither in this did he persevere, and his
father resolved to let him be a musician. He at first chose
the trumpet as his instrument, on which he acquired some
skill, and entered the service of the king as trumpeter. He
was obliged to give up the wind instrument on account of his
health, and was then Violoncellist, Violinist, and finally
Violoncellist again. For a while he was Concert Director in
Edinburgh. In 1789 he went to Dublin, and in 1791 to
London, where, besides obtaining a good position in the best
orchestras, he was principal cello at Salomon’s concerts. He
finally settled at Oxford, where he died in 1836. He published,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
for the Violoncello, thirty Duos in four books, as Op. 2, 3, 4,
and 5, as well as a School “Concise Introduction to the Art
of playing the Violoncello,” which went through four editions.</p>

<p>Reinagle’s younger brother, named <span class="smcap">Hugh</span>, born at Portsmouth
in 1766, received his education from Crosdill, and was
distinguished for his unwonted skill. He died while still
young, at Lisbon, whither he had gone for the restoration of
his failing health. Of his compositions appeared three works:
two of them, Op. 1 and 2, consist of six Cello solos, and Op. 3
contains six Duets for two Violoncellos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Gunn</span>, said to have been born in Edinburgh about
1765, was not only a clever cellist, but also a remarkable
writer on music. In the year 1790 he went to London as
a cello teacher. He there published, in 1793, an instruction
book for his instrument, under the title of “The Theory and
practice of fingering the Violoncello, containing rules and
progressive lessons for attaining the knowledge and command
of the whole compass of the instrument.” Fétis observes,
with regard to the preface of this work, consisting of two
parts, that it contains a remarkable account of the origin
of the Violoncello, as well as of old and modern stringed
instruments.</p>

<p>Gunn wrote another work, published in London in 1801,
which has reference to the Violoncello. The title of it is,
“Essay theoretical and practical on the application of
Harmony, Thorough-bass, and Modulation to the Violoncello.”
Besides this he published, in 1794, a “School of the German
flute,” and in 1807 he brought out his most important work&mdash;viz.,
“An Historical Inquiry respecting the performance on
the Harp in the Highlands of Scotland from the earliest
times until it was discontinued about the year 1734.”</p>

<p>In the year 1795 Gunn returned to Edinburgh to take up
an advantageous post that was offered to him, and which
he apparently held until his death.</p>

<p>The English possessed in <span class="smcap">Robert Lindley</span> a Violoncellist
of extraordinary capacity, who up to the present time has not
been equalled, far less excelled, by his countrymen. He
was born on March 4, 1775,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> at Rotherham, and began his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
musical studies when he was about five years of age, with his
father, an amateur performer, who began by teaching him the
violin, and, at nine years of age, the violoncello. At sixteen
he had made considerable progress, and the younger Cervetto,
hearing him play, undertook his gratuitous instruction, and
brought him to the South of England. Even at this age he
had commenced to compose for himself, and was sent for to
take the place of the professor who was to have played the
violoncello solo at one of the Brighton concerts, and who had
been taken suddenly ill. Lindley’s performance was rapturously
applauded; he played Concertos at several subsequent
concerts with the same result, and was then engaged for the
Theatre, frequently playing before the Prince Regent.</p>

<p>In 1794 he succeeded Sperati at the Opera and was principal
Violoncellist at all the concerts of any importance in London.
In the following year began the intimacy with Dragonetti,
the celebrated double-bass player, which lasted for fifty-two
years. Forster quotes Chorley’s remark that “Nothing
could be compared with the intimacy of their mutual musical
sympathy.” They played together at the same desk at the
Opera and every orchestral concert of any importance, and
Lindley’s performance of the accompaniment to Recitative
from figured bass was most “elaborate and ingenious.”</p>

<p>Concerning Lindley’s playing, he was probably the greatest
violoncellist of his time; he was distinguished for the beauty,
richness, and extreme purity of his tone, and his great
technical skill was remarkable, though probably in this and
his manner of rendering he did not equal Romberg.</p>

<p>The story is well-known how, when Romberg, during his
residence in England, heard him play, and was asked by
Salomon what he thought of his performance, replied: “He
is the devil.” He retired in 1851, and died June 13, 1855.</p>

<p>His son, William, born in 1802, was also a violoncellist,
and gave promise of future excellence, but nervousness and
delicate health prevented his attaining to any great distinction,
and he was compelled to withdraw from public appearances.</p>

<p>Lindley is less remarkable as a composer. He wrote four
Concertos, Duets for Violin and Violoncello (Op. 5), Duos for
two Violoncellos (Op. 6, 8, 10, and 27), Solos for Violoncello
(Op. 9), and several Variations on Airs, as well as Potpourris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst Lindley’s pupils, <span class="smcap">Charles Lucas</span>, born 1808, in
Salisbury, was the most remarkable. He received his first
musical instruction as chorister of the Cathedral, under
Arthur Thomas Corfe, after which he attended the Royal
Academy of Music in London. In 1830 he was named
Composer and Violoncellist to Queen Adelaide, and performed
the duties of Organist at St. George’s Chapel. Two years
later he was entrusted with the duties of Orchestra Conductor
at the Royal Academy of Music, and succeeded Cipriani
Potter as Principal in 1859. He had already taken the place
of his master, Lindley, as first Violoncellist of the Italian
Opera. He died on March 23, 1869, in London. His successor
in the Opera was the cellist, Collins.</p>

<p>To Lindley’s contemporaries must be added Cudmore,
Crouch, and Powell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Richard Cudmore</span>, born in 1787, at Chichester, in Sussex,
practised not only as cellist, but also as a violin player and
pianist. The organist, Forgett, of Chichester, was his first
instructor, and from him he learned the violin, acquiring such
proficiency that at nine years of age he played a solo at a
concert in his native town. At ten years the elder Reinagle
was his master for the Cello, and a year after he appeared
again at a concert and played his own compositions. He
then for two years pursued his studies under Salomon’s
guidance, in London, when he returned to his native town,
and remained there for the next nine years. The desire of
giving himself up anew to the study of the Piano drove him
again to London, where he subsequently appeared frequently
as a Pianist. He accomplished an artistic feat of a remarkable
description in Liverpool by appearing there at a concert,
which he himself organised, successively as Piano, Violin, and
Violoncello performer. The solos which he executed were by
Kalkbrenner, Rode, and Cervetto. He was also engaged as
Director of the orchestra of the “Gentlemen’s Concerts,” in
Manchester, for some years. His diversity of talent was
naturally an impediment to his distinguishing himself
specially in one department.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frederick William Nicholls Crouch</span>, best known as the
author of the popular air “Kathleen Mavourneen,” was born
on July 31, 1808, at Devizes. He studied under Bochsa and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
W. Hawes and at the Royal Academy, under Lindley. He played
the cello at Her Majesty’s Theatre, and was appointed principal
cellist at Drury Lane, as well as member of Queen Adelaide’s
band. He went to America with Maretzek, the German
composer, and has fallen into indigent circumstances “through
all appearance by unavoidable misfortune.” Besides numerous
other compositions, “Songs of Erin,” “Echoes of the Lakes,”
&amp;c., he produced a “Complete Treatise on the Violoncello,”
Lond., 1827.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Powell</span>, born in 1776, in London, early devoted
himself to music, and studied, besides Violoncello playing,
the piano and the harp. In 1805 he appeared with success
in his native town as solo cellist, in a Concerto which he
had composed. He then established himself in Dublin as a
teacher of music. He devoted his leisure to composition and
earnest study of his instrument. His contemporaries considered
him equal to Romberg, though this was probably going
somewhat too far, as Powell’s name was scarcely known out
of England, while Romberg, by his performances, acquired
a world-wide renown.</p>

<p>After several years’ residence in Dublin, Powell took up his
permanent abode in Edinburgh. His published compositions&mdash;amongst
which is a “Grand Duo” for Violin and Violoncello&mdash;belong
for the most part to the sphere of chamber music.</p>

<p>With regard to national English Violoncello playing,
modern times have not been more productive than the past.
Three names come before us for consideration&mdash;namely,
Howell, Whitehouse, and Ould.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward Howell</span>, born on February 5, 1846, in London, is a
pupil of the Royal Academy, and specially a pupil of Piatti’s.
He belongs to the Italian Opera as cellist, and since 1872
to Covent Garden Theatre. Besides this he is Musician in
Ordinary to the Queen, Member of the Royal Academy of
Music, and of the Philharmonic Society. He works as a
teacher at the Royal College of Music and at the Guildhall
School. He is for the most part at all the musical Festivals
in London and in the provinces, taking an active part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Edward Whitehouse</span> was born on May 20, 1859,
in London, and received instruction at eleven years of age on
the violin from Adolphe Griesbach. At thirteen he showed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
decided preference for the violoncello and was placed for four
years under Walter Pettit. In 1877 he was received into the
Royal Academy of Music and studied under Piatti and Pezze
for the violoncello and Banister for harmony. He has on
various occasions gained prizes and medals, and, in 1882,
was appointed Assistant-Professor, and, in the following year,
Professor of the Royal Academy of Music. In 1883 he was
elected Associate of the same Institution and, in 1884,
member of the Royal Society of Musicians. He is also
Professor of Cambridge University, of the Royal College of
Music, of King’s College, London, and Manchester New
College of Music under Sir Charles Hallé. During Piatti’s
absence Mr. Whitehouse has frequently taken his place at
the Saturday and Monday Popular Concerts and has for
some years been connected with Josef Ludwig’s annual series
of chamber concerts. The instrument on which Whitehouse
plays is one of the finest specimens of Francisco Ruggierius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Ould</span>, born at Romford, in Essex, came as quite
a child to London, where he has remained ever since. Until
he was sixteen years of age he practised flute playing and
singing; but the wind instrument was abandoned for the
Violoncello. He received his first instruction from a member
of the orchestra of the Italian Opera in London. A few
years later the Belgian cellist, Paque, was his master. Ould
is Musician in Ordinary to Her Majesty, and also works as
first Cellist at the Richter Concerts, as well as at all concerts
of any importance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Scandinavia</span> has, up to the present, only produced a very
modest number of noteworthy Violoncellists, and these belong
exclusively to modern times. It must, indeed, not be overlooked
that the serious encouragement of instrumental music
was taken up much later in the North than in Italy, Germany,
and France. Denmark set a good example to her Northern
neighbours, Sweden and Norway. The middle of the last
century produced a noteworthy Violin player, who belonged
to the Royal band in Copenhagen. About the same period
there was no lack of able Cellists. But their names did not
attain to any great publicity. This was the case with</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christian Kellerman</span>. He is a native of Randers, in
Jutland, and was born on January 27, 1815. It was his
father’s wish that he should devote himself to commerce, but
in this he was disappointed. Young Kellerman had inclinations
for Art and, in order to gratify them, he went, in his
fifteenth year, to Merk, in Vienna, whose pupil he was from
1830-1835. After having finished his studies he was heard
with success in Vienna and visited with good result the other
large cities of Austria and Hungary. In the year 1837 he gave
concerts at St. Petersburg. Further tours increased his reputation
and, after his return, he was summoned to be first
Violoncellist in the Royal Danish orchestra. During the year
1861 he made a journey which led him into Upper
Italy and then to Germany, where he remained until
1864. In Mayence he was, unfortunately, stricken with
paralysis. He was, indeed, able to return again in a helpless
condition to Copenhagen, but he died there two years after,
on December 3, 1866. Kellerman composed a few things for
his instrument, but nothing of much importance. His
successor was <span class="smcap">F. Rauch</span>, whose pupil, <span class="smcap">Rüdinger</span>, filled the
place of first Violoncellist in the Copenhagen Band.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz Albert Christian Rüdinger</span> was born in 1838 at
Copenhagen. After he had gone through a preparatory
course under Rauch, he received an appointment in the
Royal Orchestra, but two years later he went to Dresden,
to F. Grützmacher, whose pupil he was for some time. Having
returned home, he again filled his former place as chamber
musician, from which he was transferred, in 1874, to be first
Cellist. He at the same time accepted the Professorship at
the Copenhagen Conservatoire and he also takes part in the
regular concerts and chamber music soirées of his birthplace.</p>

<p>Next to Rüdinger, <span class="smcap">Siegfried Nebelong</span> must be mentioned
as a Scandinavian artist. He went as a boy of five to
Copenhagen, and later received his training as Cellist from
Friedrich Grützmacher, in Dresden.</p>

<h3>VIII.&mdash;THE SLAV STATES AND HUNGARY.</h3>


<p>The Violoncello was brought to Russia, as already pointed
out (p. <a href="#Page_67">67</a>), by means of the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp’s private
band. Joh. Adam Hiller’s <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wöchentliche Nachrichten die Musikbetreffend</i>
of May 21, 1770, contains the following: “When the
Duke Carl Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp (Peter the Great’s
future son-in-law) fled to the Russian Imperial Court, during
the distressed condition of his country, in the year 1720, he
conveyed with him the members of his small private band.
It consisted of about a dozen German well-trained musicians,
of whom the most famous were two brothers, Hübner&mdash;the
one was Kapellmeister and the other Concertmeister. The
selection of music, until then unheard in Russia, consisted of
Sonatas, Solos, Trios, and Concertos, by Telemann, Keiser,
Heinichen, Schulz, Fuchs, and other famous Germans of the
time, as well as by Corelli, Tartini, Porpora, and various Italian
composers; but the instruments were a Piano, some Violins,
besides a Viol d’Amore, an Alto, a Violoncello or Bassetto, a
Contra-Basso, or great Bass Violin, a couple of Hautboys, a
couple of German Flutes, two French Horns, two Trumpets,
and Kettle Drums. Peter the Great was not only very often
present at these ducal chamber concerts, but almost every
week had them to play once at his Court. This music,
therefore, met with general approbation, as it appeared to
distinguished Russians more novel and more agreeable, when
compared with other music, than any they had hitherto heard....
From that time many Russians offered themselves to be
taught by these German musicians, in order to study music
on various instruments. The Emperor Peter II. also took
lessons on the Violoncello, from the clever master of that
instrument, Riedel, a Silesian, who was also a good fencing
master, and instructed the young Emperor likewise in that
knightly art.”</p>

<p>During the life of the Empress Anna, the chamber
music once introduced into the Russian Court was retained
there, and in the absence of national artists was strengthened
by drawing into it foreign talent. King August II. of Poland
also contributed to this by giving up “some Italian virtuosi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
from his superfluity.” Amongst these was the Violoncellist,
<span class="smcap">Gasparo</span>. Later on <span class="smcap">Giuseppe dall’Oglio</span>, from Padua,
was attracted to the Russian Court. In the place of this artist&mdash;who,
in 1763, after a twenty years’ service took his leave in
order to return home&mdash;came the Italian, <span class="smcap">Cicio Polliari</span>. To
this period belongs the first Russian Violoncellist, named
<span class="smcap">Chorschevsky</span>, who received a place in the Imperial band. Up
to the present, however, in regard to the Violoncello, and
especially with respect to orchestral instruments, Russia has
remained mainly dependent for supply from abroad. Nevertheless,
since the middle of last century, the Cello has been
cultivated with success by some Russian amateurs. Their
names are&mdash;Prince <span class="smcap">Trubetzkoi</span>, Baron <span class="smcap">Stroganow</span>, and more
recently Count <span class="smcap">Matthew Wielhorski</span>. The latter, a pupil
of Bernhard Romberg, specially distinguished himself by his
performances. One of his nephews also, Count <span class="smcap">Joseph
Wielhorski</span>, who, with his talented brother <span class="smcap">Michael</span>, a pupil
of Kieseweter and Romberg, lived in Moscow, played uncommonly
well both the Violoncello and the Piano. Robert
Schumann, who in 1844, during his residence in the Kremlin,
had intercourse with both Counts, expressed himself most
enthusiastically in a letter to Fr. Wieck concerning Michael
Wielhorski, declaring he was the most highly gifted dilettante
he had ever met with.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> <span class="smcap">Michael Wielhorski</span> was born in
Volhynia in 1787, and died in 1856. The Wielhorski family
was of Polish descent, and took up their residence in Russia
after the third division of Poland.</p>

<p>At the present time amongst Russian amateurs who
play the Violoncello, Prince <span class="smcap">Tenischeff</span> and the Senator
<span class="smcap">Markewitsch</span> are distinguished; the Grand Duke <span class="smcap">Constantine
Nikolajewitsch</span> also, a pupil of J. Seifert already mentioned,
is a zealous Violoncello player.</p>

<p>The first really remarkable cellist whom Russia can call
her own is</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl Davidoff</span>. He may be reckoned amongst the most
famous representatives of his instrument at the present time.
He was born on March 15, 1838, in the little Courland town,
Goldingen, where he only spent, however, the two first years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of his life, as his parents went to Moscow in 1840. He there
began his studies with H. <span class="smcap">Schmidt</span>, who was first Cellist at the
Moscow Theatre. He carried on his further studies under
H. Schuberth, in St. Petersburg. He received his theoretical
training from Moritz Hauptmann, in Leipsic, where he appeared
at the Gewandhaus Concert towards the end of 1859. This was
such a brilliant <i>début</i> that, when Fried. Grützmacher was called
away from Leipsic to Dresden in 1860, Davidoff was offered his
place, which he accepted. He did not, however, long fill it,
having conceived the desire of undertaking a tour, which led
him into Holland. He then travelled through Russia, when
he returned to St. Petersburg. Not long after he was
appointed Imperial solo cellist, and somewhat later (1862)
teacher at the Imperial Conservatoire. In 1874 he took part
in the concerts of the Paris Conservatoire. Two years after
he was named Director of the Russian Imperial Musical
Society in St. Petersburg, as well as Director of the Conservatoire
there. He gave up the latter about two years ago.</p>

<p>Davidoff’s playing is especially distinguished for its perfect
accuracy, as well as by a clever and easy mastery of the
greatest difficulties. His Cello compositions consist of several
Concertos and a collection of agreeable Drawing-room Pieces.</p>

<p>Amongst his pupils are <span class="smcap">Albrecht</span>, <span class="smcap">Kousnetzoff</span>, <span class="smcap">Gleen</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Wergbilowitsch</span>. The latter is famous for a fine, full tone.
He played the Violoncello in the Auer String Quartet at St.
Petersburg, and is also appreciated as a solo player.</p>

<p>To the most noteworthy cellists of St. Petersburg belongs
also <span class="smcap">Arved Poorten</span>, born at Riga in 1835. He was Kummer’s
pupil in Dresden, and attended the Brussels Conservatoire
afterwards. When he had played during tours in Russia,
Belgium, and Holland, he became a member of the Russian
Imperial band and teacher at the St. Petersburg Conservatoire.
Six “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morceaux caractéristiques</span>” for his instrument
appeared in print by him.</p>

<p>Amongst the younger Russian Cello players of importance
must be mentioned: <span class="smcap">Brandoukoff</span>, <span class="smcap">Danielschenko</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Saradscheff</span>. These owe their training to William Fitzenhagen,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
in Moscow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anatole Brandoukoff</span>, born in 1859 at Moscow, was
Fitzenhagen’s pupil in the Imperial Conservatoire of his
birthplace, from September, 1870, to May, 1878, and received as
an acknowledgment on his departure from the said institution
for the distinction he had gained, a gold medal together with
an honourable diploma. His first journey was to Switzerland,
where he gave concerts in Berne and Geneva with success.
He afterwards went to Paris in 1879, appeared there and in
other French towns, and then proceeded to London. He
everywhere experienced favourable receptions. He gave
concerts with extraordinary success during the winter of
1887-1888 at Moscow and St. Petersburg. He chose Paris as
his permanent residence, where he is greatly appreciated not
only as a solo player, but also as a quartet player. Until now
only a Concerto of his Cello compositions has appeared and a
few small pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter Danielschenko</span>, born at Kiev in 1860, pursued his
studies under Fitzenhagen, in the Moscow Conservatoire, from
1873-1880. He was dismissed from there with the small gold
medal as well as an honourable diploma, and, besides, received
a special prize for composition. For a year he was then
teacher of Cello playing and theory at the Imperial Music
School in Charkow. During that time he appeared at
concerts successfully in South Russia, and had a brilliant
success in 1881 at the Great Exhibition in Moscow. He now
entered the Imperial Band and undertook the Cello instruction
at the Institute of Music of the Philharmonic Society.
He remained in that position until 1887. Since then he has
travelled in Switzerland, France, and South Russia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ivan Saradscheff</span>, born at Tiflis, in the Caucasus, in 1863,
received his training as cellist from Fitzenhagen at the Imperial
Conservatoire in Moscow, during the years 1879-1886. Distinguished
by the grant of the great silver medal together with a
diploma, after his departure from the Conservatoire he
undertook the direction of the Imperial Music School at
Tambov, but soon exchanged this place, in 1887, for that
offered to him of teacher to the Imperial Music School of his
birthplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amongst the Slavonian people, the Bohemians take the
most prominent place, having ever distinguished themselves
above others of their race in all that relates to music.
The Bohemian Violoncellists of German extraction have
already been noticed in the fifth section of this work.
We shall now consider those of distinctly Slavonic descent.</p>

<p>The oldest Bohemian Cellist of whom we have any information,
is</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignaz Mara</span>, born about 1721 in Deutschbrod. He united
to a fine intonation an execution full of expression. In 1742
he went to Berlin, was there married, and was received,
apparently through the recommendation of his countryman,
the Concertmaster, Franz Benda, into the Royal band, to
which he belonged for more than thirty years. Mara died in
Berlin in 1783. Of his Cello compositions, consisting of Concertos,
several solo pieces and Duets, nothing has been printed.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="smcap">Johann Baptist</span>, was more widely known. This was
not due to his artistic endowments only, but to the dissipated
wild life into which he fell from middle age in consequence of
intemperate habits. Endowed with extraordinary musical
talent, under the guidance of his father, he developed, during
a proportionately short time, into such an excellent Cellist
that Prince Henry of Prussia named him Chamber Musician.
As he possessed a talent for mimicry, he had also to assist on
the stage at the theatrical representations which took place in
the Castle of Rheinsberg, inhabited by the Prince.</p>

<p>Mara was born on July 20, 1744. In the year 1773 he
married the celebrated singer, Elizabeth Schmeling, who, at
that time, belonged to the Berlin Opera. He made use of the
large sums paid to his wife to gratify his passions, which led
to many disasters and to matrimonial disturbances. Besides
this he contracted debts. These irregularities increased to such
an extent that his creditors were called together against him
by the supreme court. As he had otherwise incurred the
king’s displeasure, he resolved, in agreement with his wife,
to get away secretly by night, but the attempted flight of
the married couple was stopped, and Mara condemned to
imprisonment. After he had again been set at liberty by the
intercession of his wife, he succeeded once more, in 1780, in
escaping with her, to avoid the tyranny of the King. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
took the road by Vienna and Paris to London, where
they arrived in 1784. During the year 1788-1789, they
travelled in Italy, returned to London in 1790, went
from thence to Venice, and then lived in London until
1792, where Frau Mara, wearied with the restless, wandering
life of her husband, finally separated from him in 1799. Mara
now returned to Berlin, but fell into straitened circumstances
from having become unaccustomed to work and having
neglected his art. He appeared, however, at one concert and
then went to Sondershausen, where Gerber heard him, the
author of the well-known Musical Lexicon, who said of him
that he so finely rendered his Adagio, no orchestra need be
ashamed of his playing; “and if, so continues Gerber, any one
of his tones was out of tune, it was not the fault of his
handling, but the bad and unequal stringing of his instrument.
Perhaps his show pieces deserved less credit, which,
however, appeared to be entirely in accordance with the taste
of forty years ago. In other ways he conducted himself,
while he was there, as a serious, accomplished, and thoroughly
educated man, and gave not the slightest sign of inclination
to intemperance. But he was in needy circumstances, and
although his noble-minded wife had been frightfully disgusted
at what she had suffered from him, yet in spite of this he
was, from time to time, supplied by her with considerable
sums of money.” Mara’s end was a sad one. He went, as
Gerber further says, to Holland, where “his unhappy inclination
for drink so gained the upper hand, that after having
lost all sense of honour, he used to play for dancing, day and
night, in sailors’ inns and miserable beer-houses, until at
last, in the summer of 1808, at Schiedam, near Rotterdam,
death set him free from this wretched life.” The Violoncello
compositions of Mara, which consist of two Concertos, twelve
Solos with Bass accompaniment, a Duet with Violin, and
a Sonata with Bass, remained unpublished.</p>

<p>The Bohemian, <span class="smcap">Joseph Zyka</span>,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> was about twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
older than Jos. Baptist Mara. He received his education as
Violoncellist at Prague, and belonged, from 1743-1764,
to the Electoral band in Dresden. He then went with
his son <span class="smcap">Freiderich</span>, who was likewise a good cellist, as
chamber musician to Berlin, where, according to Fétis, in
1791, he died; but, according to Fürstenau, at the beginning
of our century. He is said to have left behind him, in manuscript,
several Concertos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Hettisch</span> is distinguished as a remarkable Violoncellist.
Born in 1748, in the Bohemian town Liblin, he was
educated at the Piaristi College at Schlan, and then went to
Prague in order to train as a musician. There he still was in
the year 1772. Later, and indeed in 1788, he was, as
Gerber asserts, employed at Lemberg in the Imperial civil
service, from which it appears that in the flower of his age he
had abandoned the practice of Art as a vocation. His playing
seems to have been distinguished especially for its rich tone.
According to Fétis, he left several Concertos and Cello Solos
in manuscript.</p>

<p>The Catholic priest, <span class="smcap">Franz Mensi</span>, born on March 27,
1753, at Bistra, where his father was tutor to Count
Hohenems, early occupied himself with music, and when his
parents went to Prague he became Joseph Reicha’s pupil for
Violoncello playing while Cajetan Vogel instructed him in
theory. Mensi also played the Violin. On both instruments
he was considered clever, and not less so in composition.
Some of his works, which consist of church music, Symphonies,
and Quartets, are said to be preserved in the convent
at Strahow. In the year 1808, Mensi was still living and
working as curé at Pher. He also had some pupils, amongst
these were <span class="smcap">Joh. Brodeczky</span>, <span class="smcap">Wenzel Czižek</span>, and Count
<span class="smcap">Spork</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. Stiastny</span> (Stiasny) should be mentioned as one of the
most distinguished Bohemian Cellists. He was born in
Bohemia (according to Fétis at Prague) in 1774. The information
regarding his education and his life are very limited. He
is said to have been in the Prague Orchestra in 1800. On the
title-page of his Op. 3, consisting of a Divertimento for
Violoncello, he describes himself as Violoncellist to the
Grand Duke at Frankfort. As the brief existence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Grand Duchy of Frankfort, of which the Regent was Prince
Primate of Dalberg, occurred within the years 1810-1814,
there can scarcely be a doubt that Stiastny resided at Frankfort
during that time. Later, about 1820, he bore the title of
“Musical Director of Nuremberg,” and in that year lived at
Mannheim. He appears to have gone from there to Great
Britain, for many of his later works&mdash;as, for example, the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trois Duos Concertans</span>” (Op. 8) and the “Six <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièces faciles</span>”
(Op. 9)&mdash;are dedicated to Englishmen. Amongst these compositions
the Concertino (Op. 7), dedicated to Robert
Lindley, may be favourably distinguished from similar productions
among the Cello compositions at that period.
The remaining Cello pieces of J. Stiastny, which consist of
Variations (Op. 10), Rondo and Variations (Op. 12), two
Sonatas with Bass (Op. 2), twelve light pieces for two Cellos
(Op. 4), six similar ones (Op. 5), three Concerted Duos (Op. 6),
and Six Solos with Bass (Op. 11) are qualified to be placed
amongst the best productions of the older Cello literature, as
they contained effects which for that period were entirely
novel.</p>

<p>Amongst Stiastny’s pupils, <span class="smcap">Joseph Valentin Dont</span> was
remarkable for his performances as quartet and orchestra
player. Born on April 15, 1776, at Nieder-Georgenthal, in
Bohemia, he received instructions from Stiastny in Prague,
where he attended the school. In the year 1804 he was
enrolled into the opera orchestra of the Vienna Kärnthnerthor
Theatre, from which he was transferred to the Burg Theatre
orchestra in 1828. On December 14, 1833, he died. His son,
named Jacob, is the Viennese violinist, who died on November 18,
1888, and who was well known by the publication of his
excellent practical works for the Violin.</p>

<p>Stiastny’s elder brother, <span class="smcap">Bernhard Wenceslaus</span>, born at
Prague, 1770, was also a Violoncellist, and was employed as first
performer of his instrument in the orchestra of the Prague
Theatre. Six Sonatas for two Violoncellos, and two instruction
works were published by him. The first, entitled “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il
maëstro e lo scolare, 8 imitazioni e 6 pezzi con fughe per due
violoncelli</span>”; the other is a cello school, entitled “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méthode
de Violoncelle</span>,” in two parts. This school is carefully worked
out, though somewhat too elaborately, and yet not exhaustively;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
for the complicated technique of cello playing, especially as
regards the thumb position, has not received adequate consideration.</p>

<p>Among the younger Bohemian cellists, <span class="smcap">Wladislaw Alois</span>
is distinguished, who was born June 15, 1860, at Prague,
and received his artistic education at the Conservatoire
there. At the end of 1878 he went to Kiev, where he
gave instruction in the Institute of Music of the Musical
Society on the Violoncello and Piano. In this place he
remained for seven years. Since September, 1887, he has
been occupied as Solo Cellist at the Imperial Theatre, as well
as at the Conservatoire in Warsaw.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Poles have produced a longer list of violoncellists.
They began with <span class="smcap">Franz Xaver Woczitka</span>, a most distinguished
artist in his department, who was born in Vienna about 1730.
In 1756 he entered the service of the Court of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
He was subsequently member of the Electoral
band at Munich, where he died. He left behind him in
manuscript Concertos and Sonatas for Violoncello, which were
highly prized in their time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicol Zygmantowski</span>, born in 1770, in Poland. Gerber
asserts that already, as a child of six years and nine months,
he attracted the admiration of all who were witnesses of his
artistic proficiency; he died young. The Polish Count
Oginski,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> who was formerly much noted as a composer of
Polonaises, says in his “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres sur la Musique</span>,” that he
had heard Zygmantowski when he was twelve years old,
and adds that he possessed a wonderful talent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anton Heinrich Radziwill</span>, Count of Otyka and Nieswicz,
born on June 13, 1775, in the Grand Duchy of Posen, had a
great musical talent, and was not only an agreeable Violoncellist
but also a Composer. In the latter capacity he was
extensively known through his music to Goethe’s “Faust.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
For the Violoncello he published only one work, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Complainte
de Marie Stuart</span>,” with Piano accompaniment. The remainder
of his published compositions consist of vocal pieces, of which
one is arranged with guitar and cello accompaniment. He
was appointed by the King of Prussia, in 1815, Governor of
the Grand Duchy of Posen, and died in this prominent
position on April 7, 1833. He spent a part of the year
generally at Berlin. His house there was the centre of
artist celebrities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Korczmiet</span>, properly <span class="smcap">Kaltschmidt</span>, of German descent, an
accomplished virtuoso player, lived and worked, from 1811 to
1817, at Wilna. He had in his possession a magnificent
Stradivarius Cello, which had formerly belonged to Count
Michael Wielhorsky. This instrument is now in the possession
of Davidoff. There are no more particulars extant concerning
Korczmiet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adam Hermann</span>, born in 1800, at Warsaw, likewise of
German descent, was member of the Imperial Opera orchestra,
and teacher at the Conservatoire at Warsaw, where, about
1875, he died. During the years 1830-1875 he formed a great
number of pupils, of whom, besides his son <span class="smcap">Adam</span>, only
<span class="smcap">Komorowski</span>, <span class="smcap">Thalgrün</span>, <span class="smcap">Moniuszko</span>, and <span class="smcap">Kontski</span> will be
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adam Hermann</span>, the son, who changed his name into the
Polish form of <span class="smcap">Hermanowski</span>, was born at Warsaw in 1836,
received the first Cello instruction from his father, and in
1852 attended the Brussels Conservatoire for further training
as a pupil of Servais. Dismissed from there after two years
with the first prize, he returned home and undertook successful
tours in Poland and Russia. He is at present living in
the most absolute retirement at Warsaw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignaz Komorowski</span>, born on February 24, 1824, at Warsaw,
belonged for many years to the theatre orchestra there, after
which he benefited by the instruction of Adam Hermann, the
father. As a composer he attained great popularity in his
native land by his charming songs, full of poetical sentiment.
He died on October 14, 1857.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stanislaus Thalgrün</span>, of German descent, was born on
August 16, 1843, at Warsaw, and is member of the theatre
orchestra in his own country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boleslaw Moniuszko</span>, born on October 25, 1845, son of the
well-known Polish composer Moniuszko, belongs at the
present time to the Warsaw Theatre orchestra.</p>

<p>Finally, <span class="smcap">Sigismund Kontski</span> settled in St. Petersburg, after
having finished his training under Hermann.</p>

<p>In chronological order, after Hermann (senior), follows
<span class="smcap">Samuel Kossowski</span>, born in Galicia in 1805. He was almost
entirely self-taught and, notwithstanding, reached a high
degree as a virtuoso on the Violoncello. During the years
1842-1852 he performed at concerts, with success, in Vienna,
Berlin, Warsaw, Kiev, &amp;c. He died in 1851 at Kobryn,
in the province of Grodno.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Szablinski</span>, born on June 18, 1809, at Warsaw, was
employed as first Cellist at the Imperial Theatre for more
than forty years. He was distinguished for his fine tone and
pure musical rendering. He was especially famous as a
quartet player.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stanislaus Szczepanowski</span>, born, 1814, at Cracow, was so
accomplished as a Violoncello and Guitar player that
during the year 1839 he was able to present himself as a
Concert-giver with unusual success on both instruments in
France and England. He was also favourably heard in
Berlin. He died in 1875.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moritz Karasowski</span>, born on September 22,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> 1823, at
Warsaw, was a pupil of Valentin Kratzer, at that time
director of music there, for Violoncello and Piano playing, and
was, in 1852, member of the Warsaw Theatre orchestra. In
the years 1858 and 1860 he travelled for the sake of study and
visited Berlin, Vienna, Dresden, Munich, Cologne, and Paris.
Since 1864 he has belonged to the Dresden band as Royal
Chamber Musician. Besides some compositions for the voice
and Violoncello with piano accompaniment, of which “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rêverie
du soir</span>,” a Nocturne, and an Elegy are the most important,
he published several books in the Polish language&mdash;as, for
example: “A History of the Polish Opera” (1859), “Haydn’s
and Mozart’s Life” (1860 and 1868), “Chopin’s Youth” (Part
I. in 1862, Part II. in 1869), and Biographical Sketches of
Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, and Edmund Kretschmer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
His most important work in musical literature is “Friedrich
Chopin: his Life, his Works, and his Letters.” A German
translation of the latter appeared in 1877 which went through
two revised and enlarged editions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann Karlowicz</span>, born on May 28, 1836, in Lithuania,
received his training as Cellist from Julius Lyko in Wilna,
Göbella in Moscow, Sebastian Lee, finally from Servais also
in Brussels. For some years he assisted in the instruction
at Warsaw Conservatoire. In his native land Karlowicz
enjoys the reputation of a learned linguist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Adamowski</span>, born in 1862 in Warsaw, perfected his
studies&mdash;after he had attended the music school in his native
city for some time&mdash;under Fitzenhagen, at the Moscow
Conservatoire, in the years 1877-1883. On his leaving he
was distinguished by the presentation of a diploma and of
the great silver medal. After he had made some Concert
journeys in Poland and Galicia, he was appointed teacher at
the Cracow Conservatoire, to which he belonged until 1887.
Since then he has been without a post and is only engaged as
a Concert player. Adamowski has the reputation of being a
clever Violoncellist.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of Hungarian Violoncellists, only Kletzer and Hegyesi have
made themselves known beyond their own country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fery Kletzer</span>, born in 1830 in Hungary, travelled during
his sixteenth year giving concerts. His performances showed
more than ordinary talent, but were wanting in the higher
artistic training. He attained, however, to a certain reputation,
as his name was at the time frequently mentioned in the
newspapers. Since then he has disappeared from public life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis Hegyesi</span> holds a much higher position. He was born
on November 3, 1853, at Arpas; at eight years of age he
went to Vienna, and there received his first instruction from
the Violoncellist, Denis. Later on, he was received into
the Vienna Conservatoire and thus became Schlesinger’s
pupil. In order still further to prosecute his training he
went, in 1865, to Franchomme in Paris. The outbreak of
the Franco-German war obliged him, in the summer of 1870,
to return to Vienna, where he found a post in the orchestra of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the Grand Opera. Five years later he took Hilpert’s place in
the Florentine Quartet, to which he belonged until it was
dissolved. From that time Hegyesi has travelled as a soloist.
In 1887 he responded to an invitation to Cologne as first
Cellist of the Gürzenich Concerts and teacher at the Rhenish
School of Music.</p>




<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p>In taking a retrospective glance at the progressive development
which Violoncello playing has displayed from the
beginning of the present century, it is evident that this branch of
Art has reached so great a degree of perfection that it seems
scarcely possible it can rise much higher. This result is not
only to be ascribed to the deserving work of the leading Violoncellists&mdash;and
here must be called to mind, besides Romberg
and Dotzauer, pre-eminently Friedrich Kummer, Aug.
Franchomme, and François Servais&mdash;but also to those
famous German composers who brought the Violoncello within
the sphere of their productions.</p>

<p>Already had Haydn and Mozart appropriated to this noble
instrument, in their String Quartets, passages which contributed
to the furtherance of the technique and the possibility of
expression. Beethoven went much farther even than
this. Not only in his String and Pianoforte Trios, as well
as in his Quartets, but also in his Sonatas (Op. 5,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> 69, and 102)
and in the so-called Triple Concerto (Op. 56), he increased the
demands on the Violoncello to such an extent that in certain
respects a real impulse was given to the artistic manipulation
of the instrument. At the same time, the works referred to
had a stimulating effect on the productive work of the future in
the field of Cello compositions, which received a considerable
accession in regard to Sonatas especially. We will note here
only the names of the best known composers, who used their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
genius in this direction. They follow in alphabetical order:
<span class="smcap">W. Sterndale Bennett</span>, <span class="smcap">Joh. Brahms</span>, <span class="smcap">Fr. Chopin</span>, <span class="smcap">Fr.
Gernsheim</span>, <span class="smcap">Edv. Grieg</span>, <span class="smcap">Ferd. Hiller</span>, <span class="smcap">Friedrich Kiel</span>, <span class="smcap">Franz
Lachner</span>, <span class="smcap">Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy</span>, <span class="smcap">Ignaz Moscheles</span>,
<span class="smcap">Georg Onslow</span>, <span class="smcap">Joachim Raff</span>, <span class="smcap">Karl Reinecke</span>, <span class="smcap">Jos.
Rheinberger</span>, <span class="smcap">Ant. Rubinstein</span>, <span class="smcap">Charles Saint-Saëns</span>, <span class="smcap">Xaver
Scharwenka</span>, <span class="smcap">Bernhard Scholz</span>, and <span class="smcap">W. Taubert</span>.</p>

<p>The following have written Concertos for the Violoncello:
<span class="smcap">Albert Dietrich</span>, <span class="smcap">E. Eckert</span>, <span class="smcap">Bernh. Molique</span>, <span class="smcap">Joach. Raff</span>,
<span class="smcap">Karl Reinecke</span>, <span class="smcap">Anton Rubinstein</span>, <span class="smcap">Saint-Saëns</span>, <span class="smcap">Robert
Schumann</span>, <span class="smcap">W. Taubert</span>, and <span class="smcap">Rob. Volkmann</span>. The Concerto
which has lately appeared by <span class="smcap">Joh. Brahms</span>, for Violin and
Violoncello, must also be mentioned.</p>

<p>Besides these there exist a number, by no means small, of
greater and lesser Cello compositions, which deserve to be
prominently brought forward&mdash;as, for example: <span class="smcap">Max Bruch’s</span>
“Kol Nidrei,” Op. 47; <span class="smcap">Chopin’s</span> Introduction and Polonaise
Brilliant, Op. 3, and Duo Concertant on Themes from
“Robert le Diable” (the Cello part is Franchomme’s production);
<span class="smcap">Fr. Gernsheim’s</span> Hebrew song, “Elohenu”; <span class="smcap">Ferd.
Hiller’s</span> Concertstück, Op. 104; Duo for Pianoforte and
Violoncello, Op. 22, and two Serenades, Op. 109; <span class="smcap">Fr. Lachner’s</span>
Serenade for four Violoncellos, Op. 29, and Elegy for five
Violoncellos, Op. 160; <span class="smcap">Limmer’s</span> Trio for three Violoncellos
and Quartet for four Violoncellos; <span class="smcap">M. Marx’s</span> three Quartets
for four Violoncellos; <span class="smcap">Maurer’s</span> Nocturne for four Violoncellos;
<span class="smcap">Felix Mendelssohn’s</span> Variations for Pianoforte and Violoncello,
Op. 17; <span class="smcap">Ign. Moscheles’s</span> Duo Concertant, Op. 34;
<span class="smcap">L. Pape’s</span> six Serenades for four Violoncellos; <span class="smcap">F. E. Reinecke’s</span>
“Three Pieces,” Op. 146; <span class="smcap">Ferd. Ries’s</span> “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Air russe varié</span>,” as
well as Introduction and Rondo “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sur une danse russe</span>”;
<span class="smcap">Rob. Schumann’s</span> five “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Stücke im Volkston</span>,” Op. 102; and
likewise <span class="smcap">L. Spohr’s</span> Potpourri for Violin and Violoncello on
Themes from “Jessonda.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>If to these be added the numberless compositions which
Violoncellists of our century have produced in Concertos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Concert pieces, Variations, Fantasias, and Duets for their
instrument, it must be admitted that Violoncello literature
in the course of time has increased very extensively.</p>

<p>The “Etudes” compositions for the Violoncello left much to
be desired during the first decade of the present century. On
this account the theorist Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn, of some
consideration in his time, and who occupied himself in his
younger years with Cello playing, may have been induced to
arrange a portion&mdash;twenty-two in number&mdash;of the Kreutzer
Violin studies for the Violoncello. This work, however,
published by him in June, 1831, cannot be accounted a
particularly successful accomplishment. The finger and bow
technique of the Violoncello require an entirely different
manner of treatment from that of the Violin. And as these
Studies were written according to the capacities of the latter
instrument it is evident they can only be made available in a
limited degree for the Violoncello. It is not then to be
wondered at that the Kreutzer “Etudes,” transcribed by Dehn
with the best intention, should have fallen into oblivion, since
Violoncellists have more and more sought after a thoroughly
suitable system of “Etudes” literature, which has now grown
to be a very rich field. During the last ten years the solo
manipulation of the Violoncello has, in certain respects, undergone
a change to its advantage in a very remarkable manner.
The higher and highest tones of the instrument are no longer
unduly preferred, as in Romberg’s time; but the tenor positions,
more in accordance with its character, are chiefly used,
without, however, neglecting altogether the lower and the
higher parts. The execution of passages has greatly gained
thereby. In this respect, it is true, the Violoncello cannot
rival the Violin in brilliancy and agility. The strings of the
former being so much longer and thicker, of which the
two lower ones are made of correspondingly stout wire, form
a natural impediment to the rapid emission of tones in quick
runs and groups. In addition the somewhat muffled, though
at the same time powerful and full tone of the deeper strings
renders difficult a brilliant execution. This is felt more
especially in Violoncello Concertos with full orchestral accompaniment.
The Violoncello has, however, this advantage: that
it lends itself far less to virtuoso exaggerations and confusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
than does the easily portable violin, so favourably disposed for
every variety of unworthy trifling. The masculine character of
the Violoncello, better adapted for subjects of a serious nature,
precludes this. But then this instrument does not offer the
same wealth in means of execution which the Violin is
capable of developing as a solo instrument. In harmonics and
<i>pizzicato</i> indeed it is at least equal to it, but in the speed
and flexibility of passages, as well as in double-stopped playing,
its limits are defined. It follows that on account of the
larger dimensions of the Violoncello, and the character of
the instrument, double-stopped combinations are far less
suitable for the deeper than for the higher strings, a circumstance
of which there is no question at all on the Violin.</p>

<p>One of the strongest points which the Violoncello
possesses in its favour is its suitability as a solo instrument
in <i>Cantilena</i> playing, in which it is not surpassed by any
other. If the Violin, with melting soprano and tenor-like
voice, speaks to us now with maidenly tenderness, now
in clear jubilant tones, the Violoncello, grandly moving
for the most part in the tenor and bass positions, stirs the
soul by its fascinating sonority and its imposing power of
intonation, not less than by the pathos of its expression, which
by virtue of its peculiar quality of tone more specially
belongs to it than to the Violin.</p>

<p>There is no rivalry between the two instruments, but
rather do they mutually enhance each other’s power. Even
so is it with the themes which devolve on each in the sphere
of chamber and orchestral music. It is greatly to be desired
that future generations may foster and maintain what has
been done for the art of Violoncello playing in so meritorious
a manner by unwearied, self-sacrificing labour; but it is to be
hoped, at the same time, that the technique of the instrument,
so carefully and finely formed, to the subject of which this
book is dedicated, may be ever applied in the service of true
and noble Art only.</p>


<h3>SUPPLEMENTARY.</h3>

<p>At p. <a href="#Page_107">107</a>, I said that only Johann Baptist Baumgärtner’s
tutor (p. <a href="#Page_76">76</a>) could give an explanation concerning the
method practised in Germany, with regard to the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
finger in the thumb position, during the second half of the
last century. It was only after this was in the press that
the title of a second German Violoncello School of that time
became known to me. It is that of Kauer, who was formerly
distinguished as an operetta composer in Vienna&mdash;“Concise
explanation how to play the Violoncello”&mdash;which appeared in
1788. It may probably be seen from this work of instruction
what the opinion was at that time regarding the fourth finger
in the case referred to.</p>

<p>In England, the best violoncello as well as violin bow-maker
was John Dodd, who lived and died at Kew; indeed,
his cello bows are considered superior to his violin bows.

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Bartholomew Johnson.</span></p>

<p>The <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> of 1814 records his death thus
in the Obituary, February 14: “At Scarborough, in his
104th year, Mr. Barth. Johnson, a celebrated musical character.
He possessed to the last a vigorous mind and strong
retentive memory.”</p>

<p>In the “History of Scarborough from the earliest date,” by
Joseph Brogden Baker, among the biographical notices, is
the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Johnson, Bartholomew.</span></p>

<p>“Johnson, Barth., was born at Wykeham, near Scarborough,
October 3rd, 1710. He resided at Scarborough
from the time of his apprenticeship to the time of his death.
He was for seventy years one of the ‘town waits.’ As a
musician, and for the many excellent traits in his character,
he universally preserved the esteem of a highly respectable
circle of friends. His constitution naturally was vigorous,
and he lived to a great age. In 1810 he completed his
hundredth year, which was celebrated by a jubilee dinner
and musical performance at the Freemasons’ Lodge, Scarborough,
and a medal was struck as a memorial of this
event; about ten o’clock at night the good old man bore a
part in a quartette, performing on the violoncello the bass to
a Minuet which he himself had composed upwards of sixty
years before. Lord Mulgrave, the Honourable Henry Phipps,
the Bailiffs, and about seventy gentlemen, visitors and
residents of Scarborough and the neighbourhood, honoured
the meeting with their company. Congratulatory letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
from the borough members were read, whilst several poetical
compositions, suitable to the occasion, from the classic pens
of Archdeacon Wrangham and Thomas Hinderwell, Esq.,
were recited and sung. Lord Mulgrave afterwards commissioned
the late J. Jackson, R.A., to paint the portrait of
the venerable old man, which was presented to the Corporation
by his lordship and now adorns the council chamber of the
Town Hall. In 1814 he departed this life in the 104th year
of his age.”</p></div>

<p>A similar account, from which, perhaps, the above facts
were taken, is to be found in “The History and Antiquities
of Scarborough,” by Thomas Hinderwell, Esq.</p>


<h3><a id="C"></a>C.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Reinagle.</span></p>

<p>A whimsical circumstance, which I cannot forbear mentioning,
happened to Reinagle:&mdash;</p>

<p>The celebrated Mr. Curran introduced himself to Reinagle
and invited him to dine with some musical friends at his
country house, five miles from Dublin. Reinagle, anxious to
embrace the opportunity of enjoying that great man’s society,
most willingly assented, upon which Curran, being in great
haste, would not permit our musician to seek for any
conveyance, but requested him to ride double on his horse.
In this ludicrous way, sitting behind Mr. Curran, they

ordinary use, must not be confounded with the violin of our time. This term
was not applied to the more modern instrument until later.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A more detailed account of the above stringed instruments and their
precursors is contained in my work, “The Violin and its Masters,” Second
Edition (Leipsic: Breitkopf and Härtel), and “History of Instrumental Music
in the Sixteenth Century” (Berlin: Brachvogel and Ranft), therefore a repetition
of what is there said is unnecessary.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The “big fiddle” of the sixteenth century must not be confounded with the
stringed instrument of that time, of which the pitch answered to our modern
Contra-basso, and in Italy was already called “Violone,” as appears from
Laufranco’s “Scintille,” 1533.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The word “beschriben” refers to the letters which, for the convenience of
the player, it was the custom to mark for the fingers on the fingerboard.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Herr Obernetter, of Munich, has taken two beautiful photographs of this
richly decorated instrument, which reproduce with great accuracy all its
peculiarities. As far as I know they can still be purchased.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Here may be mentioned also a third magnificent gamba, that of Vincenzo
Ruger, said to have been made in Cremona in 1702. It is distinguished not only
for its beautiful exterior in every respect, but also by an extraordinarily sonorous
and unusually fine quality of tone, which combines the resonant character of
the gamba with that of the violoncello. The latter circumstance is attributed
to the fact that the back, which is usually flat in the ordinary gamba, is
arched in this one. This instrument, which has been lately purchased by the
Prussian Government for the Berlin Museum, was formerly in the possession of
Herr Paul de Wit, in Leipsic. The account of instrument making published
by him contains (Vol. VI., No. 21) a description and illustration of the gamba in
question.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> By the word concert, Mersennus means concerted piece.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Maugars is called in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Historiettes de Tellemant des Réaux</span>,” as Fétis
informs us, the “greatest fool that had ever lived.” His “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Réponse faite à un
curieux</span>” (completely unprejudiced, although somewhat conceited) in no way
agrees with this. It is easy to discover that Maugars was not liked by his
countrymen, because he openly declared that French music was far behind the
Italian. On that account he had incurred the displeasure of French artists.
The Parisian musician, Corrette, in the eighteenth century, was guilty of the same
offence. He had been candid enough to say to the French that the standard of
French violin playing of the eighteenth century was, compared to the Italian, in
a disorganised condition. In retaliation they called his pupils scornfully
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“les anachorètes” (“les ânes à Corette”)</span>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> I give this and the following quotations from Maugars’ writings, according
to my translations in the monthly parts of the “History of Music,” published
in the year 1878.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> The English writers on music affirm that the well-known composer,
Ferabosco, who was born at Greenwich in the second half of the sixteenth
century, and who was also called Alfonso, was the son of the above Ferabosco,
with which the remarks of Maugars agree. Fétis doubts the truth of the
assertion made by the English writers on music. The younger Ferabosco
appears also to have been a gamba player, for he published, in the year 1609, in
London, “Lessons for one, two, and three viols.” He died in 1665.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Concerning this instrument, Mattheson says: “The Angelique, somewhat
resembling the lute, must have been far easier to play, and has more cords or
strings, which one can accurately touch by reason of their arrangement without
moving the left hand much. There is nothing specially besides to remember.”
It was, therefore, an instrument of the lute kind.</p></div>

It is worthy of observation that this second fugue (D minor) has the theme
which Mozart, nearly 100 years later, made use of for the second <i>Finale</i> of the
“Magic Flute.” There is no doubt this was purely accidental, as Mozart could
hardly have seen Schenk’s work.</p></div>

untenable assertion is made that the violoncello was discovered by Bonocin
(Buononcini), “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">preséntement Maître de Chapelle du Roi de Portugal</span>.” A
Bononcini, with the Christian name of Domenico, actually lived in 1737 at the
Lisbon Court. At that period, according to Fétis, he must have been eighty-five
years old. He must therefore have been born in 1652. He could not have
invented the violoncello (if one could call it an invention), as it evidently existed
before his birth. It is not even certain that Domenico Bononcini was a cellist.
Possibly Corrette confounded him with Giov. Battista Bononcini mentioned later.</p></div>

violino “had already appeared in Lanfranco’s work ‘Scintille’ of 1533.” This
announcement has caused some confusion. Before Lanfranco’s work was
accessible to me, I also in <i>bonâ fide</i> had made the same assertion in my “History
of Instrumental Music of the Sixteenth Century” (p. 73), and I now correct it.
The word “Violino” is not mentioned by Lanfranco, but in every case only
the termination “Violone,” which is bass viol.</p></div>

“The growling Violone (French, Basse de Violon; German, Grosse Bass Geige)
is quite twice the size of the former, sometimes even more, consequently the
strings, in thickness and length, are in proportion. They are of sixteen-feet tone,
and most useful on the stage as a solid foundation for polyphonous pieces, such as
choruses and similar things, as well as for airs and recitatives; its deep humming
tone penetrates farther than the clavier and other bass instruments. It must,
however, be heavy work if one has to practise this monster for three or four
hours unceasingly.”</p></div>
